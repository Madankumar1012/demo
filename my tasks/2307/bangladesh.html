      The Bangladesh men's national cricket team (Bengali: বাংলাদেশ জাতীয়
      ক্রিকেট দল), popularly known as The Tigers,[12] is administered by the
      Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB). It is a Full Member of the International
      Cricket Council (ICC) with Test, One-Day International (ODI) and T20
      International (T20I) status. It played its first Test match in November
      2000 against India with a 9 wicket loss in Dhaka, becoming the tenth
      Test-playing nation.[13][14][15][16][17] Bangladesh became an associate
      member of the ICC in 1977,[18] and competed in six ICC Trophies, the
      leading ODI competition for non-Test playing nations.

      Bangladesh's first official foray into international cricket came in the
      1979 ICC Trophy in England. On 31 March 1986, Bangladesh played its first
      ODI match, against Pakistan in the Asia Cup. For a long time, football was
      the most popular sport in Bangladesh, but cricket gradually became very
      popular – particularly in urban areas – and by the late 1990s had
      surpassed football. Bangladesh made its full debut in international
      cricket in the 1986 Asia Cup. In 1997, Bangladesh won the ICC Trophy in
      Malaysia and thus qualified for its first Cricket World Cup to participate
      in England in 1999. There, it defeated Pakistan – causing much upset – and
      also Scotland. On 26 June 2000, Bangladesh was granted full ICC
      membership.[19][20][21][22][23] Bangladesh holds the record for most
      consecutive losses in Tests (21, between 2000 and 2002) and ODIs (23,
      between 2001 and 2004). After gaining Full Member status with the ICC,
      Bangladesh had to wait until 2004 for its first ODI win since the 1999
      World Cup. The team on the losing side on that occasion was Zimbabwe, who
      also participated in Bangladesh's maiden Test victory in 2005; by securing
      a draw in the second match, Bangladesh won their first Test series. In
      2009 Bangladesh toured the West Indies for two Tests and by winning both
      secured their first overseas Test series victory. They then came back to
      the Caribbean in 2014 for another 2 match test series and the West Indies
      claimed revenge on Bangladesh for that 2-test series loss that they gave
      them 5 years earlier by defeating in both test matches. As of 17 June
      2023, Bangladesh has played 138 Tests, winning 18. Its first victory was
      against Zimbabwe, and the next two came against the West Indies. Results
      have improved predominantly at home with draws earned against Pakistan,
      India and South Africa and wins against England, Sri Lanka, New Zealand
      and Australia.[24] They played their 100th Test when they toured Sri Lanka
      in March 2017 which they won by 4 wickets.[25][26][27][28][29][30] As of
      14 May 2023, the team has won 151 of its 412 matches.[31] They played
      their 100th ODI[32][33] when India toured Bangladesh in December 2004
      which they won, 200th ODI when Bangladesh toured West Indies in 2009 which
      they won and 300th ODI[34] in the quarter-final of the 2015 ICC Cricket
      World Cup against India. They got their 100th ODI win when Afghanistan
      toured Bangladesh in October 2016.[35][36] Bangladesh have also played 150
      T20Is, winning 54.[37] They played their 100th T20I against Zimbabwe in
      July 2021 which they won.[38][39] Results have improved with wins against
      Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, New Zealand and West Indies.[40]
      Bangladesh's major achievements include reaching the semi-finals in 2017
      ICC Champions Trophy, the quarter-finals in 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup,
      being runners up in three Asia Cups (in 2012, 2016 and 2018) and in 2018
      Nidahas Trophy and winning 2019 Ireland Tri-Nation Series which was
      Bangladesh's first ever multi-team ODI tournament final win. As of 4 March
      2023, Bangladesh is ranked 9th in Tests, 7th in ODIs and 9th in T20Is by
      the ICC.[41] History Main article: History of cricket in Bangladesh 20th
      century Several East Pakistan-based sides played in Pakistani domestic
      cricket prior to Bangladesh's declaration of independence of 1971—the East
      Pakistan cricket team fielded three players who later played ICC Trophy
      matches. In 1977, Bangladesh became an Associate member of the
      International Cricket Council (ICC).[42] Bangladesh was one of fifteen
      teams to take part in the inaugural ICC Trophy. Held in 1979, it gave
      non-Test playing countries the opportunity to qualify for that year's
      World Cup. Bangladesh, under the captaincy of Raqibul Hasan, won two
      matches and lost two, but failed to progress beyond the first
      round.[43][44] Victory in the South-East Asian Cricket Conference
      Tournament in February 1984 ensured Bangladesh qualified for the 1986 Asia
      Cup.[45] On 31 March 1986, Bangladesh played their first One Day
      International against a Full Member of the ICC.[46] 31 March 1986

      Ashraf, Bangladesh were dismissed for 94 and Pakistan reached their target
      for victory with seven wickets in hand.[47] They lost their second ODI,
      which was against Sri Lanka, finishing last in the three-team
      tournament.[48] Bangladesh qualified for the 1988 Asia Cup, this time
      hosting the tournament; it was the first time ODIs had been staged in the
      country. Although they lost all their matches, Bangladesh's fixtures were
      retrospectively awarded ODI. Floods in the preceding months meant the
      tournament was in doubt, but it went ahead as planned. A charity match
      raised $70,000 for the flood victims.[49] Bangladesh added a black mark in
      1986 ICC Trophy with only 2 wins. Bangladesh took part in the 1990
      Austral-Asia Cup,[50] the Asia Cup in 1990–91, 1995,[51] 1997,[52] and
      several other triangular tournaments, but it was not until 1998 that they
      won their first ODI. Their 22-match losing streak since their first ODI
      was at the time a record.[53] 16 May 1998 Scorecard Kenya 236 all out (49

      Umpires: SK Sharma (Ind) and C. R. Mohite[54] (Ind) Player of the match:
      Mohammad Rafique Bangladesh posted its first ODI win against Kenya, in
      India thanks largely to Mohammad Rafique, who contributed a fiery 77 runs
      and took 3 wickets. Put on 137 for the first wicket with Athar Ali Khan
      whose own contribution was 47.[55] In October 1998, Bangladesh hosted (but
      did not participate in) the first ICC KnockOut Trophy ever held (the event
      later became the ICC Champions Trophy), a knock-out ODI tournament
      featuring all the Test playing nations. Bangladesh took part in each of
      the 1979, 1982, 1986, 1990, and 1994 editions of the ICC Trophy, and won
      the trophy in 1997, in the process qualified for the 1999 World Cup. The
      then General Secretary of Bangladesh Cricket Board, Aminul Huq Moni took
      the initiative to install Astro Turf in Abahani Cricket Ground and
      Bangabandhu National Stadium, so that the local players had two full
      seasons to prepare on the type of pitch they would playing in ICC Trophy
      in 1997.[56] Bangladesh also became a regular ICC member with the right to
      play ODIs and started hosting bilateral and triangular ODI tournaments.
      Earlier, in February Dhaka hosted the third and final SAARC cricket
      tournament. Bangladesh played in its first World Cup in England in 1999
      and recorded their first win in a World Cup match against Scotland. Later
      Bangladesh created an enormous upset by beating Pakistan by 62 runs in the
      group match at Northampton. Bangladesh made 9/223 from its full 50 overs,
      and in reply, Pakistan could only manage 161 due to timely run-outs by
      wicket-keeper Khaled Mashud and some tight bowling by Khaled Mahmud, who
      took 3/31 from 10 overs. Mahmud was judged the man of the match.
      Bangladesh did not qualify for the Super Six round due to defeats in three
      of its five matches. However, the win over Pakistan, who finished
      runners-up to Australia, helped Bangladesh to gain Test playing status the
      following year. Bangladesh had sacked coach Gordon Greenidge, who had
      steered the team through the 1997 ICC Trophy and into the 1999 World Cup
      on the morning of the match.[53] Former South Africa Test cricketer Eddie
      Barlow became Bangladesh's coach in 1999.[57] In preparation for becoming
      a Test playing country, Bangladesh established its own first-class
      competition in 1999–2000, although the matches were not given first-class
      status until the 2000–2001 season.[58] The lack of an established
      first-class structure in the country until shortly before Bangladesh
      played its debut Test has been cited as one of the reasons the side
      struggled to adapt to the longer format of the game.[59] The West Indies
      toured Bangladesh in October, winning both matches in the ODI series.[60]
      After suffering a stroke in April 2000, Barlow vacated the position of
      coach[61] and Sarwar Imran was handed the coaching job.[62] In May and
      June 2000, Bangladesh hosted the Asia Cup; Bangladesh lost all three of
      their matches and playing against Pakistan Bangladesh recorded the
      heaviest defeat in ODIs, a margin of 233 runs at the time.[63] Bangladesh
      participated in the 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy in October; their only match
      ended in defeat by England.[61] First years as a Test team (2000–2003) On
      13 November 2000, Bangladesh played their inaugural Test match, hosting
      India in Dhaka. 10–13 November 2000 Scorecard Bangladesh v India 400
      (153.3 Overs) Aminul Islam Bulbul 145 (380) Sunil Joshi 5/142 (45.3 Overs)

      by 9 wickets Bangabandhu National Stadium, Dhaka Umpires: Steve Bucknor
      (WI) and David Shepherd (ENG) Player of the match: Sunil Joshi Bangladesh
      won the toss and elected to bat Sameen Ishraq, Akram Khan, Al Sahariar,
      Aminul Islam Bulbul, Habibul Bashar, Khaled Mashud, Mehrab Hossain,
      Mohammad Rafique, Naimur Rahman, Ranjan Das, Hasibul Hossain and Shahriar
      Hossain made their Test debuts for Bangladesh. Shiv Sunder Das, Saba Karim
      and Zaheer Khan made their debuts for India. Aminul Islam Bulbul became
      third cricketer in history to score a century on his country's inaugural
      test.[64] The first Test run in the history of Bangladesh Cricket came
      from the bat of Mehrab Hossain, who also scored the first ODI hundred by
      an individual player for Bangladesh in 1999. Captained by Naimur Rahman,
      Bangladesh lost by nine wickets, although Wisden noted that they
      "surpassed all expectations by matching their neighbours, and at times
      even enjoying the upper hand".[65] Aminul Islam Bulbul scored 145 in the
      first innings, becoming the third person to have scored a century in their
      team's first Test; Rahman took six wickets for 132 runs, the second-best
      bowling figures in a country's maiden Test.[65] In March 2001, former
      Australian Test cricketer Trevor Chappell was appointed coach.[66] The
      following month Bangladesh embarked on a tour of Zimbabwe to play two
      Tests and three ODIs. Zimbabwe, who at the time were ranked ninth out of
      the ten Test teams, won all five matches.[67] Bangladesh took part in the
      2001–02 Asian Test Championship, the second and final time the
      championship was held and the first the team had been eligible to play in.
      They lost both their matches by an innings. Mohammad Ashraful made his
      debut in the series and became the youngest player to score a Test century
      in his first match.[68] In November, Bangladesh hosted Zimbabwe for two
      Tests and three ODIs. The opening Test was curtailed by bad weather and
      ended in a draw; after losing their first five Tests, it was the first
      time Bangladesh had avoided defeat. Zimbabwe won all the remaining
      matches. After the Test series wicketkeeper Khaled Mashud replaced Rahman
      as captain.[69] The following month Bangladesh toured New Zealand for two
      Test matches. Bangladesh's batsmen struggled in unfamiliar conditions and
      the team slumped to two innings defeats.[70] In January 2002, Bangladesh
      hosted Pakistan for two Tests and three ODIs where Bangladesh lost all the
      matches. At this point, they had lost ten of their first eleven Tests;
      only South Africa had struggled as much in their introduction to Test
      cricket, also losing ten of their first eleven matches. Chappell blamed
      Bangladesh's batsmen for the loss, saying "they commit the same mistakes
      again and again, and need to learn to apply themselves, to bat in
      sessions".[71] In April, former Pakistan Test cricketer Mohsin Kamal
      replaced Chappell as coach.[66] When Bangladesh toured Sri Lanka in July
      and August they were on the receiving end of Sri Lanka's largest margin of
      victory in Test cricket: an innings and 196 runs. Bangladesh lost both
      Tests and all three ODIs on the tour, recording their 50th defeat in 53
      ODIs. Repeated poor performances prompted people to question whether
      Bangladesh had been granted Test status too soon.[72] Two defeats against
      Australia and New Zealand in pool matches knocked Bangladesh out of the
      2002 ICC Champions Trophy. In October, Bangladesh got whitewashed in both
      Test and ODI series against in South Africa.Wisden noted that "Time and
      again ... came the mantra that [Bangladesh] would learn from the
      experience, that they could only improve by playing against the best, that
      there was genuine talent in the squad. But it wore thin."[73] The final
      defeat set a record for most consecutive losses in ODIs (23), beating the
      previous record, which was also held by Bangladesh.[74] When West Indies
      toured in November and December, Bangladesh lost both Test and two out of
      the three ODIs, and one ended in no result.[75] Bangladesh hit several new
      lows on the third day of the first Test: their lowest innings total (87),
      their lowest match aggregate (226), and the biggest defeat in their 16
      Tests (by an innings and 310 runs).[76] South Africa hosted the 2003 World
      Cup in February and March. Bangladesh lost five of their six matches (one
      ended in no result),[77] including fixtures against Canada, who hadn't
      played international cricket since the 1979 World Cup,[78] and Kenya, who
      eventually made the semi-finals of the tournament. In the aftermath of
      Bangladesh's World Cup campaign, Habibul Bashar replaced Khaled Mashud as
      captain,[79] and Kamal was sacked as coach with Dav Whatmore taking over
      the role.[80] Whatmore was not able to begin the job immediately, so
      Sarwar Imran acted as interim coach during TVS Cup and South Africa's tour
      of Bangladesh in April and May.[81] Bangladesh lost all four ODIs by large
      margins and two Tests by innings. Under Dav Whatmore (2003–2007)
      Bangladesh played two Test and three ODI matches on a mid-year tour of
      Australia in 2003.They lost every single match on that tour. In August
      2003, Bangladesh toured Pakistan to play three Tests and five ODIs
      matches. This was Bangladesh's second tour to Pakistan, with the first
      occurring in 2001–02, when the teams played one Test match. Both series
      ended in whitewash, with Pakistan winning the Test series 3 – 0 and the
      ODI series 5 – 0.[82][24][83] In the first Test match of that series, Alok
      Kapali became the first Bangladesh player to take a hat-trick in Test
      cricket, dismissing Shabbir Ahmed, Danish Kaneria, and Umar Gul.[84][85]
      However, in the third Test match of that series, Bangladesh came very
      close to its first Test victory, when it lost to Pakistan by only one
      wicket. It was just the tenth time in Test history that a team had lost by
      a single wicket.[86] In September–October 2003, England played 2 Tests and
      3 ODIs against Bangladesh. England won both the Test matches and won all
      three ODIs by 7 wickets. Bangladesh's captain, Mahmud, was booed.[87]
      Ahead of Bangladesh's tour of Zimbabwe in February and March the next
      year, he was dropped from the squad and batsman Habibul Bashar was granted
      the captaincy.[88] At the time, Zimbabwe were without many of their senior
      players. Bangladesh lost the Test series 1–0, and the ODI series 2–1.[89]
      The second Test was drawn after 3 days of no play due to heavy rains[90]
      and brought an end to their run of 21 consecutive defeats dating back to
      November 2001, a world record in Test cricket.[91] The solitary ODI
      victory was Bangladesh's first international win since defeating Pakistan
      in the 1999 World Cup.[92] Bangladesh's next matches were against the West
      Indies in May and June. Bangladesh lost the ODI series 3–0 and the Test
      series 1–0; by securing a hard-fought draw in the first match, Bangladesh
      managed to avoid defeat for just the third time in 29 Tests.[93]
      Bangladesh participated 2004 Asia Cup and 2004 ICC Champions Trophy
      winning only one match against Hong Kong. In the following months,
      Bangladesh suffered heavy defeats in Tests and in ODIs against touring New
      Zealand and India. However, in December, India toured Bangladesh in
      December 2004. In 2nd ODI of the series, Bangladesh defeated India in its
      hundredth ODI, this being only the third time that it had won against a
      Test playing nation.
