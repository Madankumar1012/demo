    <h1>2023 cricket world cup</h1>
    <p>
      The 2023 ICC Men's Cricket World Cup will be the 13th edition of the
      Cricket World Cup, a quadrennial One Day International (ODI) cricket
      tournament contested by men's national teams and organized by the
      International Cricket Council (ICC). It is scheduled to be hosted by India
      From 5 October to 19 November 2023. 10 teams will contest the tournament;
      England are the defending champions, having won the previous edition in
      2019. It will be the first men's Cricket World Cup to be hosted solely by
      India, after co-hosting the 1987, 1996, and 2011 tournaments with other
      countries on the Indian subcontinent. The final is scheduled to be played
      at the Narendra Modi Stadium on 19 November 2023. Mumbai and Kolkata will
      host the two semifinals.

    <h1>background</h1>
    <p>
      Originally, the tournament was scheduled to be played from 9 February to
      26 March 2023[1][2] however, in July 2020, it was announced that the
      tournament would be delayed to an October November window,[3][4] following
      the disruption of the qualification schedule due to the COVID-19
      pandemic.[3] In March 2023, ESPNcricinfo reported that the tournament was
      expected to be played from 5 October to 19 November.[5] ICC released the
      tournament schedule on 27 June.[6][7] The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) had
      threatened to boycott the World Cup after the Board of Control for Cricket
      in India (BCCI) refused to send its team to the 2023 Asia Cup scheduled in
      Pakistan.[8][9] On 15 June 2023, the Asian Cricket Council announced that
      2023 Asia Cup will be hosted in a hybrid model as proposed by PCB.[10][11]
      However, before the announcement of schedule of 2023 Asia Cup, former PCB
      chairman Najam Sethi expressed his unwillingness to play any group league
      matches at Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad except the knockout matches,
      subject to clearance from the Government of Pakistan. He also wished to
      have all their games played in Bengaluru, Chennai, or Kolkata.[12]

    <h1>Qualification</h1>
    <h2>Main article: 2023 Cricket World Cup qualification</h2>
    <p>
      The tournament will feature ten teams, like the previous edition. The main
      route for qualification will be the 2020-2023 ICC Cricket World Cup Super
      League tournament.[13] The top seven sides plus the hosts (India) from the
      thirteen competitors in the Super League are qualified for this World Cup.
      The remaining five teams, along with five associate sides, are presently
      playing in the 2023 Cricket World Cup Qualifier, from which two teams will
      go through to the final tournament.[14][15]
