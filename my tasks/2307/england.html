      The England cricket team represents England and Wales in international
      cricket. Since 1997, it has been governed by the England and Wales Cricket
      Board (ECB), having been previously governed by Marylebone Cricket Club

      International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I) status. Until the
      1990s, Scottish and Irish players also played for England as those
      countries were not yet ICC members in their own right. England and
      Australia were the first teams to play a Test match (15–19 March 1877),
      and along with South Africa, these nations formed the Imperial Cricket
      Conference (the predecessor to today's International Cricket Council) on
      15 June 1909. England and Australia also played the first ODI on 5 January
      1971. England's first T20I was played on 13 June 2005, once more against
      Australia. As of 2 July 2023, England have played 1,063 Test matches,
      winning 389 and losing 320 (with 354 draws).[10] In the Test series
      against Australia, England play for The Ashes, one of the most famous
      trophies in all of sport, and they have won the urn on 32 occasions.
      England have also played 779 ODIs, winning 392.[11] They have appeared in
      the final of the Cricket World Cup four times (1979, 1987, 1992), and
      winning their first in 2019; they have also finished as runners-up in two
      ICC Champions Trophies (2004 and 2013). England have played 173 T20Is,
      winning 90.[12] They won the ICC T20 World Cup in 2010 and 2022, and were
      runners-up in 2016. They are the current World champions in both ODIs and
      T20Is, as of May 2023, and were the first team to hold both titles
      concurrently. As of 12 June 2023, England are ranked third in Tests, fifth
      in ODIs and second in T20Is by the ICC.[1] History Main articles: History
      of the England cricket team to 1939 and History of the England cricket
      team from 1945 The All-England Eleven in 1846 The first recorded incidence
      of a team with a claim to represent England comes from 9 July 1739 when an
      "All-England" team, which consisted of 11 gentlemen from any part of
      England exclusive of Kent, played against "the Unconquerable County" of
      Kent and lost by a margin of "very few notches".[13] Such matches were
      repeated on numerous occasions for the best part of a century. In 1846
      William Clarke formed the All-England Eleven. This team eventually
      competed against a United All-England Eleven with annual matches occurring
      between 1847 and 1856. These matches were arguably the most important
      contest of the English season if judged by the quality of the players.
      Early tours The 1859 English team to North America. The first overseas
      tour occurred in September 1859 with England touring North America. This
      team had six players from the All-England Eleven, six from the United
      All-England Eleven and was captained by George Parr. With the outbreak of
      the American Civil War, attention turned elsewhere. English tourists
      visited Australia in 1861–62 with this first tour organised as a
      commercial venture by Messrs Spiers and Pond, restaurateurs of Melbourne.
      Most matches played during tours prior to 1877 were "against odds", with
      the opposing team fielding more than 11 players to make for a more even
      contest.[14] This first Australian tour was mostly against odds of at
      least 18/11. The first England team to tour southern Australia in 1861–62
      The tour was so successful that Parr led a second tour in 1863–64. James
      Lillywhite led a subsequent England team which sailed on the P&O steamship
      Poonah on 21 September 1876. They played a combined Australian XI, for
      once on even terms of 11-a-side. The match, starting on 15 March 1877 at
      the Melbourne Cricket Ground came to be regarded as the inaugural Test
      match. The combined Australian XI won this Test match by 45 runs with
      Charles Bannerman of Australia scoring the first Test century. At the
      time, the match was promoted as James Lillywhite's XI v Combined Victoria
      and New South Wales.[14] The teams played a return match on the same
      ground at Easter, 1877, when Lillywhite's team avenged their loss with a
      victory by four wickets. The first Test match on English soil occurred in
      1880 with England victorious; this was the first time England fielded a
      fully representative side with W. G. Grace included in the team.[15] 1880s
      The death notice printed on The Sporting Times newspaper which first named
      the Ashes. England lost their first home series 1–0 in 1882, with The
      Sporting Times printing an obituary on English cricket: In Affectionate
      Remembrance OF ENGLISH CRICKET, WHICH DIED AT THE OVAL ON 29th AUGUST,
      1882, Deeply lamented by a large circle of sorrowing friends and
      acquaintances. R. I. P. N.B.—The body will be cremated and the ashes taken
      to Australia.[16] As a result of this loss, the tour of 1882–83 was dubbed
      by England captain Ivo Bligh as "the quest to regain the ashes". England,
      with a mixture of amateurs and professionals, won the series 2–1.[17]
      Bligh was presented with an urn that contained some ashes, which have
      variously been said to be of a bail, ball or even a woman's veil, and so
      The Ashes was born. A fourth match was then played which Australia won by
      four wickets. However, the match was not considered part of the Ashes
      series.[17][18] England dominated many of these early contests, with
      England winning the Ashes series 10 times between 1884 and 1898.[19]
      During this period England also played their first Test match against
      South Africa in 1889 at Port Elizabeth.[20] 1890s England won the 1890
      Ashes series 2–0, with the third match of the series being the first Test
      match to be abandoned. England lost 2–1 in the 1891–92 series, although
      England regained the urn the following year. England again won the 1894–95
      series, winning 3–2 under the leadership of Andrew Stoddart. In 1895–96,
      England played South Africa, winning all Tests in the series. The 1899
      Ashes series was the first tour where the MCC and the counties appointed a
      selection committee. There were three active players: Grace, Lord Hawke
      and Warwickshire captain Herbert Bainbridge. Prior to this, England teams
      for home Tests had been chosen by the club on whose ground the match was
      to be played. England lost the 1899 Ashes series 1–0, with Grace making
      his final Test appearance in the first match of the series. 1900s The
      start of the 20th century saw mixed results for England as they lost four
      of the eight Ashes series between 1900 and 1914.[21] During this period,
      England lost their first series against South Africa in the 1905–06 season
      4–1 as their batting faltered.[22] England lost their first series of the
      new century to Australia in 1901–02 Ashes. Australia also won the 1902
      series, which was memorable for exciting cricket, including Gilbert Jessop
      scoring a Test century in just 70 minutes. England regained the Ashes in
      1904 under the captaincy of Pelham Warner. R. E. Foster scored 287 on his
      debut and Wilfred Rhodes took 15 wickets in a match. In 1905–06, England
      lost 4–1 against South Africa. England avenged the defeat in 1907, when
      they won the series 1–0 under the captaincy of Foster. However, they lost
      the 1909 Ashes series against Australia, suing 25 players in the process.
      England also lost to South Africa, with Jack Hobbs scoring his first of 15
      centuries on the tour. 1910s England toured Australia in 1911–12 and beat
      their opponents 4–1. The team included the likes of Rhodes, Hobbs, Frank
      Woolley and Sydney Barnes. England lost the first match of the series but
      bounced back and won the next four Tests. This proved to be the last Ashes
      series before the war. The 1912 season saw England take part in a unique
      experiment. A nine-Test triangular tournament involving England, South
      Africa and Australia was set up. The series was hampered by a very wet
      summer and player disputes however and the tournament was considered a
      failure with the Daily Telegraph stating:[23] Nine Tests provide a surfeit
      of cricket, and contests between Australia and South Africa are not a
      great attraction to the British public. With Australia sending a weakened
      team and the South African bowlers being ineffective England dominated the
      tournament winning four of their six matches. The match between Australia
      and South Africa at Lord's was visited by King George V, the first time a
      reigning monarch had watched Test cricket.[24] England went on one more
      tour before the outbreak of the First World War, beating South Africa 4–0,
      with Barnes taking 49 wickets in the series. 1920s English cricket team at
      the Test match at the Brisbane Exhibition Ground in 1928. England won by a
      record margin of 675 runs. England's first match after the war was in the
      1920–21 season against Australia. Still feeling the effects of the war
      England went down to a series of crushing defeats and suffered their first
      whitewash losing the series 5–0. Six Australians scored hundreds while
      Mailey spun out 36 English batsmen. Things were no better in the next few
      Ashes series losing the 1921 Ashes series 3–0 and the 1924–25 Ashes 4–1.
      England's fortunes were to change in 1926 as they regained the Ashes and
      were a formidable team during this period dispatching Australia 4–1 in the
      1928–29 Ashes tour. In the same year the West Indies became the fourth
      nation to be granted Test status and played their first game against
      England. England won each of these three Tests by an innings, and a view
      was expressed in the press that their elevation had proved a mistake
      although Learie Constantine did the double on the tour. In the 1929–30
      season England went on two concurrent tours with one team going to New
      Zealand (who were granted Test status earlier that year) and the other to
      the West Indies. Despite sending two separate teams England won both tours
      beating New Zealand 1–0 and the West Indies 2–1. 1930s Bill Woodfull
      evades a Bodyline ball. Note the number of leg-side fielders. The 1930
      Ashes series saw a young Don Bradman dominate the tour, scoring 974 runs
      in his seven Test innings. He scored 254 at Lord's, 334 at Headingley and
      232 at The Oval. Australia regained the Ashes winning the series 3–1. As a
      result of Bradman's prolific run-scoring the England captain Douglas
      Jardine chose to develop the already existing leg theory into fast leg
      theory, or bodyline, as a tactic to stop Bradman. Fast leg theory involved
      bowling fast balls directly at the batsman's body. The batsman would need
      to defend himself, and if he touched the ball with the bat, he risked
      being caught by one of a large number of fielders placed on the leg side.
      Using Jardine's fast leg theory, England won the next Ashes series 4–1,
      but complaints about the Bodyline tactic caused crowd disruption on the
      tour, and threats of diplomatic action from the Australian Cricket Board,
      which during the tour sent the following cable to the MCC in London:
      Bodyline bowling assumed such proportions as to menace best interests of
      game, making protection of body by batsmen the main consideration. Causing
      intensely bitter feeling between players as well as injury. In our opinion
      is unsportsmanlike. Unless stopped at once likely to upset friendly
      relations existing between Australia and England. Later, Jardine was
      removed from the captaincy and the Laws of Cricket changed so that no more
      than one fast ball aimed at the body was permitted per over, and having
      more than two fielders behind square leg was banned. England's following
      tour of India in the 1933–34 season was the first Test match to be staged
      in the subcontinent. The series was also notable for Stan Nichols and
      Nobby Clark bowling so many bouncers that the Indian batsman wore solar
      toupées instead of caps to protect themselves. Australia won the 1934
      Ashes series 2–1 and kept the urn for the following 19 years. Many of the
      wickets of the time were friendly to batsmen resulting in a large
      proportion of matches ending in high scoring draws and many batting
      records being set. England drew the 1938 Ashes, meaning Australia retained
      the urn. England went into the final match of the series at The Oval 1–0
      down, but won the final game by an innings and 579 runs. Len Hutton made
      the highest ever Test score by an Englishman, making 364 in England first
      innings to help them reach 903, their highest ever score against
      Australia. The 1938–39 tour of South Africa saw another experiment with
      the deciding Test being a timeless Test that was played to a finish.
      England lead 1–0 going into the final timeless match at Durban. Despite
      the final Test being 'timeless', the game ended in a draw after 10 days as
      England had to catch the train to catch the boat home. A record 1,981 runs
      were scored, and the concept of timeless Tests was abandoned. England went
      on one final tour of the West Indies in 1939 before the Second World War,
      although a team for an MCC tour of India was selected more in hope than
      expectation of the matches being played. 1940s Test cricket resumed after
      the war in 1946, and England won their first match back against India.
      However, they struggled in the 1946–47 Ashes series, losing 3–0 in
      Australia under Wally Hammond's captaincy. England beat South Africa 3–0
      in 1947 with Denis Compton scoring 1,187 runs in the series. The 1947–48
      series against the West Indies was another disappointment for England,
      with the side losing 2–0 following injuries to several key players.
      England suffered further humiliation against Bradman's invincible side in
      the 1948 Ashes series. Hutton was controversially dropped for the third
      Test, and England were bowled out for just 52 at The Oval. The series
      proved to be Bradman's final Ashes series. In 1948–49, England beat South
      Africa 2–0 under the captaincy of George Mann. The series included a
      record breaking stand of 359 between Hutton and Cyril Washbrook. The
      decade ended with England drawing the Test series against New Zealand,
      with every match ending in a draw. 1950s Their fortunes changed on the
      1953 Ashes tour as they won the series 1–0. England did not lose a series
      between their 1950–51 and 1958–59 tours of Australia and secured famous
      victory in 1954–55 under the captaincy of Len Hutton, thanks to Frank
      Tyson whose 6/85 at Sydney and 7/27 at Melbourne are remembered as the
      fastest bowling ever seen in Australia. The 1956 series was remembered for
      the bowling of Jim Laker who took 46 wickets at an average of 9.62,
      including figures of 19/90 at Old Trafford. After drawing to South Africa,
      England defeated the West Indies and New Zealand comfortably. The England
      team then left for Australia in the 1958–59 season with a team that had
      been hailed as the strongest ever to leave on an Ashes tour but lost the
      series 4–0 as Richie Benaud's revitalised Australians were too strong,
      with England struggling with the bat throughout the series. On 24 August
      1959, England inflicted its only 5–0 whitewash over India. All out for 194
      at The Oval, India lost the last test by an innings. England's batsman Ken
      Barrington and Colin Cowdrey both had an excellent series with the bat,
      with Barrington scoring 357 runs across the series and Cowdrey scoring
      344. 1960s The early and middle 1960s were poor periods for English
      cricket. Despite England's strength on paper, Australia held the Ashes and
      the West Indies dominated England in the early part of the decade. May
      stood down as captain in 1961 following the 1961 Ashes defeat. Ted Dexter
      succeeded him as captain but England continued to suffer indifferent
      results. In 1961–62, they beat Pakistan, but also lost to India. The
      following year saw England and Australia tie the 1962–63 Ashes series 1–1,
      meaning Australia retained the urn. Despite beating New Zealand 3–0,
      England went on to lose to the West Indies, and again failed in the 1964
      Ashes, losing the home series 1–0, which marked the end of Dexter's
      captaincy. However, from 1968 to 1971 they played 27 consecutive Test
      matches without defeat, winning 9 and drawing 18 (including the abandoned
      Test at Melbourne in 1970–71). The sequence began when they drew with
      Australia at Lord's in the Second Test of the 1968 Ashes series and ended
      in 1971 when India won the Third Test at The Oval by four wickets. They
      played 13 Tests with only one defeat immediately beforehand and so played
      a total of 40 consecutive Tests with only one defeat, dating from their
      innings victory over the West Indies at The Oval in 1966. During this
      period they beat New Zealand, India, the West Indies, and Pakistan, and
      under Ray Illingworth's leadership, regained The Ashes from Australia in
      1970–71. 1970s The 1970s, for the England team, can be largely split into
      three parts. Early in the decade, Illingworth's side dominated world
      cricket, winning the Ashes away in 1971 and then retaining them at home in
      1972. The same side beat Pakistan at home in 1971 and played by far the
      better cricket against India that season. However, England were largely
      helped by the rain to sneak the Pakistan series 1–0 but the same rain
      saved India twice and one England collapse saw them lose to India. This
      was, however, one of (if not the) strongest England team ever with the
      likes of Illingworth, Geoffrey Boycott, John Edrich, Basil D'Oliveira,
      Dennis Amiss, Alan Knott, John Snow and Derek Underwood at its core. The
      mid-1970s were more turbulent. Illingworth and several others had refused
      to tour India in 1972–73 which led to a clamour for Illingworth's job by
      the end of that summer – England had just been beaten 2–0 by a flamboyant
      West Indies side – with several England players well over 35. Mike Denness
      was the surprising choice but only lasted 18 months; his results against
      poor opposition were good, but England were badly exposed as ageing and
      lacking in good fast bowling against the 1974–75 Australians, losing that
      series 4–1 to lose the Ashes. Denness was replaced in 1975 by Tony Greig.
      While he managed to avoid losing to Australia, his side were largely
      thrashed the following year by the young and very much upcoming West
      Indies for whom Greig's infamous "grovel" remark acted as motivation.
      Greig's finest hour was probably the 1976–77 win over India in India. When
      Greig was discovered as being instrumental in World Series Cricket, he was
      sacked, and replaced by Mike Brearley. Brearley's side showed again the
      hyperbole that is often spoken when one side dominates in cricket. While
      his side of 1977–80 contained some young players who went on to become
      England greats, most notably future captains Ian Botham, David Gower and
      Graham Gooch, their opponents were often very much weakened by the absence
      of their World Series players, especially in 1978, when England beat New
      Zealand 3–0 and Pakistan 2–0 before thrashing what was effectively
      Australia's 2nd XI 5–1 in 1978–79. 1980s The England team, with Brearley's
      exit in 1980, was never truly settled throughout the 1980s, which will
      probably be remembered as a low point for the team. While some of the
      great players like Botham, Gooch and Gower had fine careers, the team
      seldom succeeded in beating good opposition throughout the decade and did
      not score a home Test victory (except against minnows Sri Lanka) between
      September 1985 and July 1990. Botham took over the captaincy in 1980 and
      they put up a good fight against the West Indies, losing a five match Test
      series 1–0, although England were humbled in the return series. After
      scoring a pair in the first Test against Australia, Botham lost the
      captaincy due to his poor form, and was replaced by Brearley. Botham
      returned to form and played exceptionally in the remainder of the series,
      being named man of the match in the third, fourth and fifth Tests. The
      series became known as Botham's Ashes as England recorded a 3–1 victory.
      Keith Fletcher took over as captain in 1981, but England lost his first
      series in charge against India. Bob Willis took over as captain in 1982
      and enjoyed victories over India and Pakistan, but lost the Ashes after
      Australia clinched the series 2–1. England hosted the World Cup in 1983
      and reached the semi-finals, but their Test form remained poor, as they
      suffered defeats against New Zealand, Pakistan and the West Indies. Gower
      took over as skipper in 1984 and led the team to a 2–1 victory over India.
      They went on to win the 1985 Ashes 3–1, although after this came a poor
      run of form. Defeat to the West Indies dented the team's confidence, and
      they went on to lose to India 2–0. In 1986, Micky Stewart was appointed
      the first full-time England coach. England beat New Zealand, but there was
      little hope of them retaining the Ashes in 1986–87. However, despite being
      described as a team that 'can't bat, can't bowl and can't field', they
      went on to win the series 2–1. After losing consecutive series against
      Pakistan, England drew a three match Test series against New Zealand 0–0.
      They reached the final of the 1987 World Cup, but lost by seven runs
      against Australia. After losing 4–0 to the West Indies, England lost the
      Ashes to a resurgent Australia led by Allan Border. With the likes of
      Gooch banned following a rebel tour to South Africa, a new look England
      side suffered defeat again against the West Indies, although this time by
      a margin of 2–1. 1990s If the 1980s were a low point for English Test
      cricket, then the 1990s were only a slight improvement. The arrival of
      Gooch as captain in 1990 forced a move toward more professionalism and
      especially fitness though it took some time for old habits to die. Even in
      2011, one or two successful county players have been shown up as
      physically unfit for international cricket. Creditable performances
      against India and New Zealand in 1990 were followed by a hard-fought draw
      against the 1991 West Indies and a strong performance in the 1992 Cricket
      World Cup in which the England team finished as runners-up for the second
      consecutive World Cup, but landmark losses against Australia in 1990–91
      and especially Pakistan in 1992 showed England up badly in terms of
      bowling. So bad was England's bowling in 1993 that Rod Marsh described
      England's pace attack at one point as "pie throwers". Having lost three of
      the first four Tests played in England in 1993, Gooch resigned to be
      replaced by Michael Atherton. More selectorial problems abounded during
      Atherton's reign as new chairman of selectors and coach Ray Illingworth
      (then into his 60s) assumed almost sole responsibility for the team off
      the field. The youth policy which had seen England emerge from the West
      Indies tour of 1993–94 with some credit (though losing to a seasoned
      Windies team) was abandoned and players such as Gatting and Gooch were
      persisted with when well into their 30s and 40s. England continued to do
      well at home against weaker opponents such as India, New Zealand and a
      West Indies side beginning to fade but struggled badly against improving
      sides like Pakistan and South Africa. Atherton had offered his resignation
      after losing the 1997 Ashes series 3–2 having been 1–0 up after two
      matches – eventually to resign one series later in early 1998. England,
      looking for talent, went through a whole raft of new players during this
      period, such as Ronnie Irani, Adam Hollioake, Craig White, Graeme Hick and
      Mark Ramprakash. At this time, there were two main problems: The lack of a
      genuine all-rounder to bat at 6, Botham having left a huge gap in the
      batting order when he retired from Tests in 1992. Alec Stewart, a sound
      wicket-keeper and an excellent player of quick bowling, could not open and
      keep wicket, hence his batting down the order, where he was often exposed
      to spin which he did not play as well. Stewart took the reins as captain
      in 1998, but another losing Ashes series and early World Cup exit cost him
      Test and ODI captaincy in 1999. This should not detract from the 1998 home
      Test series where England showed great fortitude to beat a powerful South
      African side 2-1. Another reason for their poor performances were the
      demands of County Cricket teams on their players, meaning that England
      could rarely field a full-strength team on their tours. This eventually
      led to the ECB taking over from the MCC as the governing body of England
      and the implementation of central contracts. 1992 also saw Scotland sever
      ties with the England and Wales team, and begin to compete as the Scotland
      national team. By 1999, with coach David Lloyd resigning after the World
      Cup exit and new captain Nasser Hussain just appointed, England hit rock
      bottom (literally ranked as the lowest-rated Test nation) after losing 2-1
      to New Zealand in shambolic fashion. Hussain was booed on the Oval balcony
      as the crowd jeered "We've got the worst team in the world" to the tune of
      "He's Got the Whole World in His Hands". 2000s Central contracts were
      installed - reducing players workloads - and following the arrival of
      Zimbabwean coach Duncan Fletcher, England thrashed the fallen West Indies
      3
      . England's results in Asia improved that winter with series wins
      against both Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Hussain's side had a far harder edge
      to it, avoiding the anticipated "Greenwash" in the 2001 Ashes series
      against the all-powerful Australian team. The nucleus the side was slowly
      coming together as players such as Hussain himself, Graham Thorpe, Darren
      Gough and Ashley Giles began to be regularly selected. By 2003 though,
      having endured another Ashes drubbing as well as another first-round exit
      from the World Cup, Hussain resigned as captain after one Test against
      South Africa. Michael Vaughan took over, with players encouraged to
      express themselves. England won five consecutive Test series prior to
      facing Australia in the 2005 Ashes series, taking the team to second place
      in the ICC Test Championship table. During this period England defeated
      the West Indies home and away, New Zealand, and Bangladesh at home, and
      South Africa in South Africa. In June 2005, England played its first ever
      T20 international match, defeating Australia by 100 runs. Later that year,
      England defeated Australia 2–1 in a thrilling series to regain the Ashes
      for the first time in 16 years, having lost them in 1989. Following the
      2005 Ashes win, the team suffered from a spate of serious injuries to key
      players such as Vaughan, Giles, Andrew Flintoff and Simon Jones. As a
      result, the team underwent an enforced period of transition. A 2–0 defeat
      in Pakistan was followed by two drawn away series with India and Sri
      Lanka. In the home Test series victory against Pakistan in July and August
      2006, several promising new players emerged. Most notable were the
      left-arm orthodox spin bowler Monty Panesar, the first Sikh to play Test
      cricket for England, and left-handed opening batsman Alastair Cook. The
      2006–07 Ashes series was keenly anticipated and was expected to provide a
      level of competition comparable to the 2005 series. In the event, England,
      captained by Flintoff who was deputising for the injured Vaughan, lost all
      five Tests to concede the first Ashes whitewash in 86 years. In the 2007
      Cricket World Cup, England lost to most of the Test playing nations they
      faced, beating only the West Indies and Bangladesh, although they also
      avoided defeat by any of the non-Test playing nations. Even so, the
      unimpressive nature of most of their victories in the tournament, combined
      with heavy defeats by New Zealand, Australia and South Africa, left many
      commentators criticising the manner in which the England team approached
      the one-day game. Coach Duncan Fletcher resigned after eight years in the
      job as a result and was succeeded by former Sussex coach Peter Moores. In
      2007–08, England toured Sri Lanka and New Zealand, losing the first series
      1–0 and winning the second 2–1. These series were followed up at home in
      May 2008 with a 2–0 home series win against New Zealand, with the results
      easing pressure on Moores – who was not at ease with his team,
      particularly star batsman Kevin Pietersen. Pietersen succeeded Vaughan as
      captain in June 2008, after England had been well beaten by South Africa
      at home. The poor relationship between the two came to a head on the
      2008–09 tour to India. England lost the series 1–0 and both men resigned
      their positions, although Pietersen remained a member of the England team.
      Moores was replaced as coach by Zimbabwean Andy Flower. Against this
      background, England toured the West Indies under the captaincy of Andrew
      Strauss and, in a disappointing performance, lost the Test series 1–0. The
      2009 Ashes series featured the first Test match played in Wales, at Sophia
      Gardens, Cardiff. England drew the match thanks to a last-wicket stand by
      bowlers James Anderson and Panesar. A victory for each team followed
      before the series was decided at The Oval. Thanks to fine bowling by
      Stuart Broad and Graeme Swann and a debut century by Jonathan Trott,
      England regained the Ashes.
