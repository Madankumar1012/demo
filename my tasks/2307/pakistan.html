      The Pakistan national cricket team has represented Pakistan in
      international cricket since 1952. It is controlled by the Pakistan Cricket
      Board (PCB), the governing body for cricket in Pakistan, which is a Full
      Member of the International Cricket Council (ICC). Pakistan compete in
      cricket tours and tournaments sanctioned by the PCB and other regional or
      international cricket bodies in Test, One Day International (ODI), and
      Twenty20 International (T20) formats.

      Pakistan were given test status in 1952 following a recommendation from
      India, but faced limited international success until the 1980s, when they
      became fixtures in the latter stages of tournaments. They won their first
      international trophy, the ICC World Cup, in 1992, and then won the Asia
      Cup in 2000. They saw increased success in the 21st century, winning the
      T20 World Cup in 2009, the Asia Cup in 2012, and ICC Champions Trophy in
      2017. Pakistan is the only team to have won each major ICC tournament, won
      the first Asian Test Championship in 1999, and was the fourth team to win
      the now-defunct ICC Test Championship in 2016.[18][19] Pakistan have the
      second-highest win percentage in international T20 cricket (with a minimum
      of 150 games played),[20] the fourth-highest win percentage in ODI
      cricket,[21] and the fourth-best win-loss ratio in Test cricket (both with
      a minimum of 400 games played).[22] Pakistan has been plagued by security
      concerns and domestic instability due to terrorism and the war on terror,
      restricting it as a venue for international cricket in the 21st century.
      Despite hosting the 1987 and 1996 World Cups (with the 1996 final played
      in Lahore), cricket was not played in the country after an attack against
      the Sri Lanka national team in 2009; Pakistan then played one-day games in
      the United Arab Emirates until 2016 and Test games in the UAE until
      2019.[23][24] International cricket was resumed in Pakistan from 2016,
      which coincided with the debut of the Pakistan Super League, following
      improvements in security and overall reduction in terrorism.[25][26]

      The match held between Sindh  Australia in Karachi on 22 November 1935
      was reported by The Sydney Morning Herald Cricket in Pakistan has a
      history predating the creation of the country in 1947. The first ever
      international cricket match in Karachi was held on 22 November 1935
      between Sindh and Australian cricket teams. The match was seen by 5,000
      Karachiites.[27] Ghulam Mohammad was the captain of team Sind and Frank
      Tarrant was the captain of Tarrant's team. Following the independence of
      Pakistan in 1947, cricket in the country developed rapidly and Pakistan
      was given Test match status at a meeting of the Imperial Cricket
      Conference at Lord's in England on 28 July 1952 following recommendation
      by India,[28] which, being the successor state of the British Raj, did not
      have to go through such a process. The first captain of the Pakistan
      national cricket team was Abdul Hafeez Kardar. Pakistan's first Test match
      was played in Delhi in October 1952 as part of a five Test series which
      India won 2–1. Pakistan made their first tour of England in 1954 and drew
      the series 1–1 after a victory at The Oval in which fast bowler Fazal
      Mahmood took 12 wickets. Pakistan's first home Test match was against
      India in January 1955 at Bangabandhu National Stadium, Dacca, East
      Pakistan (now Bangladesh), after which four more Test matches were played
      in Bahawalpur, Lahore, Peshawar and Karachi (all five matches in the
      series were drawn, the first such occurrence in Test history[29]). The
      team is considered a strong but unpredictable team. Traditionally
      Pakistani cricket has been composed of talented players but is alleged to
      display limited discipline on occasion, making their performance
      inconsistent at times. In particular, the India-Pakistan cricket rivalry
      is usually emotionally charged and can provide for intriguing contests, as
      talented teams and players from both sides of the border seek to elevate
      their game to new levels. Pakistan team contests with India in the Cricket
      World Cup have resulted in packed stadiums and highly charged atmospheres.
      The team is well supported at home and abroad, especially in the United
      Kingdom where British Pakistanis have formed a fan-club called the "Stani
      Army". Members of the club show up to matches across the country and are
      known to provide raucous support. The Stani Army also takes part in
      charity initiatives for underprivileged Pakistanis, including annual
      friendly cricket matches against British Indian members of the similar
      "Bharat Army". 1986 Austral-Asia Cup (Champions) Main article:
      Austral-Asia Cup The 1986 Austral-Asia Cup, played in Sharjah in UAE, saw
      a last-ball victory for Pakistan against their arch-rivals India, with
      Javed Miandad emerging as a national hero.[30] India batted first and set
      a target of 245 runs, leaving Pakistan with a required run rate of 4.92
      runs per over. Miandad came in to bat at number 3 and Pakistan lost
      wickets at regular intervals. Later recalling the match, he stated that
      his main focus was to lose with dignity. With 31 runs needed in the last
      three overs, Miandad hit a string of boundaries while batting with his
      team's lower order, until four runs were required from the last delivery
      of the match. Miandad received a leg side full toss from Chetan Sharma,
      which he hit for six over the midwicket boundary.[30][31] 1992 Cricket
      World Cup (Champions) Main article: 1992 Cricket World Cup Pakistani
      opener Yasir Hameed playing against Australia at Lord's in England At the
      1992 World Cup Semi-final, having won the toss, New Zealand chose to bat
      first and ended with a total of 262 runs. Pakistan batted conservatively
      yet lost wickets at regular intervals. With the departure of Imran Khan
      and Saleem Malik shortly thereafter, Pakistan still required 115 runs at a
      rate of 7.67 runs per over with veteran Javed Miandad being the only known
      batsman remaining at the crease. A young Inzamam-ul-Haq, who had just
      turned 22 and was not a well-known player at the time, burst onto the
      international stage with a match-winning 60 off 37 balls. Once Inzamam got
      out, Pakistan required 36 runs from 30 balls, which wicket-keeper Moin
      Khan ended with a towering six over long off, followed by the winning
      boundary to midwicket. The match is seen as the emergence of Inzamam onto
      the international stage.[32][33][34] The 1992 Cricket World Cup in
      Australia and New Zealand marked Pakistan's first World Cup victory. It is
      remembered for the comeback Pakistan made after losing key players such as
      Waqar Younis and Saeed Anwar and being led by an injured captain Imran
      Khan. Pakistan lost 3 of their first 5 matches and were nearly eliminated
      in the first round of the tournament after being bowled out for 74 runs
      against England, until the match was declared as a "no result" due to
      rain. Imran Khan told the team to play like "cornered tigers", after which
      Pakistan won five successive matches, including the semi-final against
      hosts New Zealand and the final against England.[35] 2007 Cricket World
      Cup The 2007 Cricket World Cup was one of the biggest upsets in World Cup
      history when Pakistan was knocked out of the competition in a shock defeat
      to Ireland, who were playing in their first competition. Pakistan, needing
      to win to qualify for the next stage after losing to the West Indies in
      their opening match, were put into bat by Ireland. They lost wickets
      regularly and only 4 batsmen scored double figures. In the end they were
      bowled out by the Irish for 132 runs. The Irish went on to win the match,
      after Niall O'Brien scored 72 runs. This meant that Pakistan had been
      knocked out during the first round for the second consecutive World
      Cup.[36][37][38] Tragedy struck the team when coach Bob Woolmer died one
      day later on 18 March 2007 in a hospital in Kingston, Jamaica. Jamaican
      police spokesman Karl Angell reported on 23 March 2007 that, "Mr Woolmer's
      death was due to asphyxiation as a result of manual strangulation" and
      that, "Mr Woolmer's death is now being treated by the Jamaica police as a
      case of murder."[39] Assistant coach Mushtaq Ahmed acted as temporary
      coach for the team's final group game of the tournament.[40] Subsequent to
      his team's defeat and the death of Woolmer, Inzamam-ul-Haq announced his
      resignation as captain of the team and his retirement from one-day
      cricket, stating that he would continue to take part in Test cricket but
      not as captain.[41] Shoaib Malik was announced as his successor.[42]
      Following his return to the squad, Salman Butt was appointed as
      vice-captain until December 2007.[43] On 23 March 2007, Pakistan players
      and officials were questioned by Jamaican police and submitted DNA samples
      along with fingerprints, as part of the routine enquiries in the
      investigation into Woolmer's murder.[44] Three days after leaving the West
      Indies for Pakistan, via London, the Pakistan team were ruled out as
      suspects. The deputy commissioner of Jamaican police. Mark Shields, the
      detective in charge of the investigation, announced, "It's fair to say
      they are now being treated as witnesses." "I have got no evidence to
      suggest it was anybody in the squad."[45] A memorial service was held in
      Sacred Heart Church, Lahore, for Bob Woolmer on 1 April 2007. Among the
      attendees were Pakistan players and dignitaries, including Inzamam-ul-Haq,
      who was quoted as saying, "After Woolmer's family, the Pakistan team was
      the most aggrieved by his death."[46] After the World Cup ended, serious
      doubts were raised about the investigation, with increasing speculation
      that Woolmer died of natural causes. This has now been accepted as fact,
      and the case has been closed.[47] On 20 April 2007, a PCB official
      announced that former Test cricketer Talat Ali would act as interim coach,
      in addition to his rôle as team manager, until a new coach had been
      appointed.[48] On 16 July 2007, Geoff Lawson, previously head coach of New
      South Wales, was appointed coach of Pakistan for two years, becoming the
      third foreigner to take on the rôle.[49] In the 2007 ICC World Twenty20,
      Pakistan exceeded expectations to reach the final but ended as runners-up,
      after losing the final to India in a nail-biting finish. On 25 October
      2008, Intikhab Alam was named as a national coach of the team by the PCB.
      2009 ICC World T20 (Champions) In the final at Lord's, the home of cricket
      in London, Sri Lanka won the toss and elected to bat. The first over was
      bowled by Mohammad Amir. After failing to score off the first four balls –
      all short – Dilshan went for his scoop and mistimed it, resulting in him
      being caught at short fine-leg. Soon after this, Jehan Mubarak top-edged a
      delivery by Abdul Razzaq which went high in the air and was caught by
      Shahzaib Hasan, leaving Sri Lanka at 2 for 2.[13] Sanath Jayasuriya was
      able to stabilise the innings for Sri Lanka hitting 17 runs off 10 balls,
      however, Jayasuriya soon fell as he dragged a good length ball back on to
      the stumps. Mahela Jayawardene followed after edging a shot into the hands
      of Misbah-ul-Haq, leaving Sri Lanka on 32/4.[14] Sangakkara and Chamara
      Silva added further runs before the latter was caught by Saeed Ajmal
      playing a pull shot off the bowling of Umar Gul.[15] Shahid Afridi soon
      after, took the wicket of Isuru Udana with a googly which drifted into the
      right-hander, knocking the off-stump. This brought in Angelo Mathews, who
      along with Sangakkara took the score from 70/6 to 138/6, with 17 runs
      being scored off the last over bowled by Mohammad Amir. Sri Lanka finished
      on 138/6 from 20 overs.[16] Pakistan started off well with openers Kamran
      Akmal and Shahzaib Hasan adding 48 runs for the 1st wicket before Kamran
      Akmal was stumped by Kumar Sangakkara by the first delivery of Sanath
      Jayasuriya.[13] Pakistan reached the target in 18.4 overs, with Shahid
      Afridi, who hit the winning runs, earning Man of the Match[17] while
      Tillakaratne Dilshan was declared Man of the Series for his 317 runs at an
      average of 63.40. Pakistan's win often cheered on by crowds of fans from
      England's Pakistani communities, marked its first world title since Imran
      Khan's "cornered tigers" had won the 1992 World Cup."We all know how
      important this World Cup was with so much happening in Pakistan," Afridi
      said. "The guys motivated themselves for this World Cup." Shahid Afridi
      batting against Sri Lanka in the ICC World Twenty20 Final at Lord's in
      England Afridi had a quiet start to the tournament with the bat but
      responded strongly with match-winning half-centuries in the semi-final and
      final. He also took 11 wickets in the tournament. He said the support
      staff, including the head coach Intikhab Alam and bowling coach Aaqib
      Javed, played a role in shaping the team's victory. "They all really
      worked hard with the guys and kept them united and close to each other,
      that's why we had success," Afridi said. Shahid Afridi was the man who won
      the heart of people of Pakistan 2010 ICC World T20 (Semi-finalists) The
      2010 World T20 was held in West Indies, where Pakistan was able to reach
      for the semi-final stage. Pakistan, Australia and Bangladesh were in Group
      A. Pakistan won the first match against Bangladesh by 21 runs. Salman Butt
      became the hero of the match with his 73 runs from just 46 balls. The
      second match for Pakistan was with Australia, where Australia won the toss
      and elected to bat. They scored 191/10 with 49 ball 81 runs by Shane
      Watson. In this match, final over of Australian innings was bowled by
      Mohammad Amir. He took a triple-wicket maiden and there were two run-outs,
      and eventually five wickets fell in the final over of Australia's innings.
      In Super 8s stage, Pakistan lost to England, and New Zealand, only won
      against South Africa. They finished only behind England in Group E of
      Super 8s, reached to the semi-finals The semi-final for Pakistan was again
      with Australia, where they scored 191/6 with Umar Akmal's not out 56 runs.
      Australia had a good start, where Michael Hussey scored a match winning
      unbeaten 64 runs from just 24 balls. Australia scored 197/7 in 19.5 overs
      and won the match. With this match, Pakistan lost their defended World T20
      title. 2011 Cricket World Cup (Semi-finalists) Pakistan started well in
      the ICC Cricket World Cup, which was held in India, Sri Lanka and
      Bangladesh, after beating Kenya, Sri Lanka (one of the tournament
      favourites) and bye a margin, beating Canada. Shahid Afridi clearly stated
      that his team is capable of qualifying for the Semifinals. After a huge
      loss against New Zealand, Pakistan defeated Zimbabwe by 7 wickets. After
      victory against Zimbabwe Pakistan cemented their shot at playing the ICC
      CWC 2011 Quarters. One of the highlights of the tournament for Pakistan
      was when they beat Australia, who were led by 3 brilliant pace bowlers,
      Brett Lee, Shaun Tait and Mitchell Johnson. However Pakistan defied the
      odds and defeated Australia, courtesy of a brilliant bowling display. This
      saw Australia's record win streak of 27 consecutive world cup games broken
      which saw them win every game between the 1999 world cup up until this
      game. In the quarter-finals they played West Indies. Pakistan were
      ruthless, as they emphatically won against the West Indies side by 10
      wickets, due to another brilliant bowling display. In the semi-finals on
      30 March, Pakistan had a match with its fiercest rival, India. India
      managed 260 after they batted first. Not having a good batting line-up
      along with a slow start to the chase, Pakistan were 29 runs short as India
      reached the final (India went on to win the final, by defeating Sri
      Lanka).
