      Cricket was introduced to the Indian subcontinent by British sailors in
      the 18th century, and the first cricket club was established in 1792.
      India's men's national cricket team played its first international match
      on 25 June 1932 in a Lord's Test against England becoming the sixth team
      to be granted Test cricket status. India had to wait until 1952, almost
      twenty years, for its first Test victory. In its first fifty years of
      international cricket, success was limited, with only 35 wins in 196
      Tests.[12] The team, however, gained strength in the 1970s with the
      emergence of players like Sunil Gavaskar, Gundappa Viswanath, Kapil Dev,
      and the Indian spin quartet. In men's limited-overs cricket, India made
      its ODI and T20I debuts in 1974 and 2006, respectively. The team has won
      five major ICC tournaments, winning the Cricket World Cup twice (1983 and
      2011), the ICC T20 World Cup once (2007) and the ICC Champions Trophy
      twice (2002 and 2013) and have also finished as runners-up in the World
      Cup once (2003), the T20 World Cup once (2014), and the Champions Trophy
      twice (2000 and 2017). The team were also part of ICC World Test
      Championship finals in the first two editions (2019-21, 2021-23). It was
      the second team after the West Indies to win the World Cup and the first
      team to win the World Cup on home soil after winning the 2011 Cricket
      World Cup. They have also won the Asia Cup seven times, in 1984, 1988,
      1990-91, 1995, 2010, 2016 and 2018, whilst finishing runners-up thrice
      (1997, 2004, 2008). The team also won the 1985 World Championship of
      Cricket, defeating Pakistan in the final. Other achievements include
      winning the ICC Test Championship Mace five times and the ICC ODI
      Championship Shield once. As of June 2023, the team is ranked first in
      Tests, third in ODIs and first in T20Is in the ICC rankings.[13]

    <h1>history</h1>
    <h2>early history</h2>
    <p class="three">
      The British brought cricket to India in the early 1700s, with the first
      cricket match played in 1721.[14] In 1848, the Parsi community in Mumbai
      formed the Oriental Cricket Club, the first cricket club to be established
      by Indians. After slow beginnings, the Europeans eventually invited the
      Parsis to play a match in 1877.[15] By 1912, the Parsis, Hindus, Sikhs and
      Muslims of Bombay played a quadrangular tournament with the Europeans
      every year.[15] In the early 1900s, some Indians went on to play for the
      England cricket team. Some of these, such as Ranjitsinhji and Duleepsinhji
      were greatly appreciated by the British and their names went on to be used
      for the Ranji Trophy and Duleep Trophy - two major first-class tournaments
      in India. In 1911, an Indian men's cricket team, captained by Bhupinder
      Singh of Patiala, went on their first official tour of the British Isles,
      but only played English county teams and not the England cricket
      team.[16][17]
