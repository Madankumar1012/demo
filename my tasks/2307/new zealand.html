    <p class="three">
      The New Zealand national cricket team represents New Zealand in men's
      international cricket. Named the Black Caps, they played their first Test
      in 1930 against England in Christchurch, becoming the fifth country to
      play Test cricket. From 1930 New Zealand had to wait until 1956, more than
      26 years, for its first Test victory, against the West Indies at Eden Park
      in Auckland.[13] They played their first ODI in the 1972–73 season against
      Pakistan in Christchurch.

      Kane Stuart Williamson (born 8 August 1990) is a New Zealand cricketer who
      is currently the captain of the New Zealand national team in limited overs
      cricket. On 27 February 2023, Williamson became the all-time leading
      runscorer for New Zealand in test cricket. [1] He is a right-handed
      batsman and an occasional off spin bowler. He is widely regarded as one of
      the best batsmen of the modern era. Williamson made his first-class
      cricket debut in December 2007.[2] He made his U-19 debut against the
      touring Indian U-19 team the same year and was named captain of the New
      Zealand U-19 team for the 2008 U-19 Cricket World Cup. He made his
      international debut in 2010. Williamson has represented New Zealand at the
      2011, 2015 and 2019 editions of the Cricket World Cup and 2012, 2014, 2016
      and 2021 editions of the ICC World Twenty20. He made his full-time
      captaincy debut for New Zealand in the 2016 ICC World Twenty20 in India.
      He captained New Zealand at the 2019 Cricket World Cup, leading the team
      to the final and winning the Player of the Tournament award in the
      process. On 31 December 2020, he reached a Test batting rating of 890,
      surpassing Steve Smith and Virat Kohli as the number one ranked Test
      batsmen in the world.[3][4] He was nominated for the Sir Garfield Sobers
      Award for ICC Male Cricketer of the Decade, and the award for Test
      cricketer of the decade. Ian Chappell and Martin Crowe have ranked
      Williamson among the top four or five Test cricket batsmen, along with Joe
      Root, Steve Smith, and Virat Kohli of the current era.[5][6][7] Williamson
      was the only New Zealander to be named in the ICC Test Team of the Decade
      (2011–2020).[8] The late former New Zealand cricketer, Martin Crowe, noted
      that, "we're seeing the dawn of probably our greatest ever batsman" in
      Williamson.[9] In June 2021, he captained New Zealand to win the inaugural
      ICC World Test Championship, the first ICC trophy the team won since
      winning the 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy. In November 2021, he led New Zealand
      to the final of the ICC T20 World Cup. Early life Williamson was born on 8
      August 1990 in Tauranga, New Zealand.[10] His father Brett was a sales
      representative who had played under-17 and club cricket in New Zealand and
      his mother Sandra had been a representative basketball player. He has a
      twin brother Logan, who is one minute younger than him. The brothers have
      three older sisters, Anna, Kylie and Sophie. All three were accomplished
      volleyball players, and Anna and Sophie were in New Zealand age group
      teams. Williamson's grandmother Joan Williamson-Orr served as mayor of
      Taupō. His first cousin Dane Cleaver has also played international cricket
      for New Zealand.[11] Williamson played senior representative cricket at
      the age of 14 and first-class cricket at 16. He attended Tauranga Boys'
      College from 2004 to 2008, where he was head boy in his final year. He was
      coached by Pacey Depina who described Williamson as having "a thirst to be
      phenomenal – but not at anyone else's expense."[12][13] He reportedly
      scored 40 centuries before he left school.[14] Domestic career Northern
      Districts Williamson made his debut for Northern Districts in 2007 at the
      age of 17, who he has remained with for the duration of his New Zealand
      domestic career.[15][16] He scored his first T20 hundred, on 19 September
      2014, making 101* in 49 balls to guide Northern Districts to a comfortable
      win against Cape Cobras in Champions League Twenty20 2014.[17] English
      county cricket Williamson signed for Gloucestershire to play in the 2011
      English county season.[18] On 14 August 2013, he signed for Yorkshire for
      the rest of the season and subsequently signed to return for the 2014
      season, when his side won the County Championship.[19][20] He signed to
      return the latter part of the 2015 season, but when incumbent overseas
      player Aaron Finch was not selected for the Australia ODI squad, Yorkshire
      ultimately chose to extend Finch's deal in place of Williamson.[21][22] He
      subsequently signed a deal for part of the 2016 season, and also returned
      for a part of the 2018 season .[23] Indian Premier League In February 2015
      Williamson signed for Indian Premier League side Sunrisers Hyderabad
      (SRH). He played for the side in the 2016 season, winning the title, and
      was retained for the 2017 and 2018 seasons. He captained the side in 2018,
      replacing David Warner.[24][25] Under Williamson's captaincy, Sunrisers
      Hyderabad finished runners-up and he was the season's leading scorer, with
      735 runs.[26] In IPL 2021, Kane took over the captaincy from David Warner
      in the middle of the season.[27] He was retained by the franchise for the
      2022 edition as the captain, but failed to perform, scoring one
      half-century.[28][29] Ahead of the 2023 season he was bought by Gujarat
      Titans, but was injured in the first match of the season.[30]
      International career Williamson was 17, when he led the New Zealand
      Under-19 side in the World Cup in Malaysia in 2008. New Zealand reached
      the semi-final, where they lost to the eventual champions India. On 24
      March 2010, Williamson was named in the New Zealand Test squad for the
      second Test against Australia,[31] but ultimately he did not play in the
      match.[32] Williamson made his One-Day International debut against India
      on 10 August 2010. He was dismissed for a 9th ball duck. In his second
      match, he was bowled by Angelo Mathews for a second ball duck. He scored
      his maiden ODI century against Bangladesh on 14 October 2010 in Dhaka and
      hence became the youngest centurion in New Zealand's cricket history. Due
      to his performance on the Bangladesh tour where New Zealand suffered a 4–0
      whitewash, Williamson was selected in the New Zealand Test squad for the
      tour of India that followed.[33] Williamson made his Test cricket debut
      against India at Ahmedabad on 4 November 2010. In his first innings he
      scored 131 runs off 299 balls and became the eighth New Zealand player to
      score a century on Test debut.[34][35] Rising through the ranks Williamson
      scored 161 not out against West Indies in June 2014, his second century of
      the series and helped secure a rare away Test series victory for his side.
      He finished as the leading overall run scorer in the series with 413 runs,
      and was denied a double century only by rain,[citation needed] which
      encouraged skipper Brendon McCullum to declare in the interest of
      obtaining a result in the match. He was also reported for a suspect
      bowling action in April 2014, but was cleared in December 2014.[36] His
      illegal bowling action started after he left high school in order to get a
      faster release and turn on the ball.[citation needed] His new action
      essentially reverts him to his action in high school, with a more side-on
      approach and less wrist and elbow deviation.[citation needed] He was also
      named as captain ahead of the ODI and Twenty20 series against Pakistan as
      Brendon McCullum was rested.[37] Williamson batting against Sussex in 2013
      Williamson scored 100* off 69 balls against Zimbabwe at Bulawayo, which at
      the time was the second fastest century by a New Zealander in a One-Day
      International.[38] He also established one of the most potent top-order
      partnership with Ross Taylor, with Williamson himself being the most
      prolific number-three batsman for the national side since former captain
      Stephen Fleming. As a fielder, his position is predominantly at
      gully.[citation needed] In 2015, he started with 69 and 242* against Sri
      Lanka, with two catches in the field in a man-of-the-match
      performance.[39] On 3 February 2015, he scored the 99th ODI century in the
      New Zealand's history, against Pakistan; Ross Taylor scored the 100th in
      the same match. He also scored over 700 runs before the 2015 Cricket World
      Cup in the first two months of the calendar year. On 17 June 2015 he
      became the fifth-fastest batsmen and fastest New Zealander to score 3,000
      runs, getting them in just 78 innings. On 15 November 2015 Williamson and
      Taylor became the first pair of away batsmen to each score 2nd innings
      centuries at WACA Ground in Perth.[citation needed] In December 2015,
      during the second Test against Sri Lanka, Williamson broke the record for
      the most Test runs scored in a calendar year by a New Zealander, with 1172
      runs.[40] He also ended 2015 with 2692 runs, the highest total across all
      forms of international cricket for the year, and third highest total in a
      single year.[41] He was awarded the T20 Player of the Year by NZC for the
      2014–15 season.[42] Captaincy In March 2016, Williamson assumed the
      position of captain of New Zealand across all forms of cricket after the
      retirement of Brendon McCullum, beginning with the World T20I cup in
      India. He was named as captain of the 'Team of the Tournament' by Cricinfo
      and Cricbuzz.[43][44] He also picked up NZ player of the year, Test player
      of the year and the Redpath Cup for top batsman in first class cricket for
      the second year in a row.[45][46] In August 2016, during the Test series
      against Zimbabwe, Williamson became the thirteenth batsman to score a
      century against all the other Test playing nations. He completed this in
      the fewest innings,[needs update] the quickest time from his Test debut
      and became the youngest player to achieve this feat.[47] Williamson set a
      new record for scoring the most centuries by a New Zealand batsman in
      Tests, with his 18th, in March 2018 when he score 102 against England at
      Auckland.[48] Later that year, he scored his 10,000th run in first-class
      cricket, batting for the English side Yorkshire in the 2018 County
      Championship.[49] On 8 December 2018, he scored his 19th Test century in
      the deciding 3rd game in the Pakistan away series. On 7 December 2018,
      Williamson became the first player from New Zealand to cross 900 rating
      points in the ICC Test batting rankings.[50] During the 2019 Test series
      against Bangladesh, Williamson scored 200 not out as New Zealand posted a
      team total of 715, their highest ever in a Test innings. He also became
      the fastest New Zealand player to score 6,000 runs in Test
      cricket.[51][52] In April 2019, he was named the captain of New Zealand's
      squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup.[53][54] During the tournament, he
      scored an unbeaten 106 to guide New Zealand to victory over South
      Africa,[55] scoring his 3,000th run as captain of New Zealand in ODIs in
      the process.[56] On 22 June, Williamson scored 148 runs off 154 balls in a
      5-run victory over West Indies, his career best score in ODI cricket.[57]
      One week later, in the match against Australia, Williamson became the
      third-fastest batsman, in terms of innings, to score 6,000 runs in ODIs,
      doing so in his 139th innings.[58] At the end of the World Cup, he was
      awarded the Player of the Tournament award after becoming the highest
      scoring captain in a single World Cup, making 578 runs in 10 matches.[59]
      He was named as captain of the 'Team of the Tournament' by the ICC and
      ESPNCricinfo.[60][61][62][63] In November 2020, Williamson was nominated
      for the Sir Garfield Sobers Award for ICC Male Cricketer of the Decade,
      and the award for Test cricketer of the decade.[64][65] On 4 December,
      Williamson scored 251 runs, his highest test score, in the first innings
      of the first Test against West Indies and helped New Zealand win the match
      by an innings and 134 runs.[66][67] In June 2021, he led New Zealand to
      victory in the inaugural ICC World Test Championship, beating India in the
      final by eight wickets. In August 2021, Williamson was named as the
      captain of New Zealand's squad for the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup.[68]
      Under his captaincy, New Zealand reached their third consecutive ICC event
      final across all formats after beating England in the semi-final of the
      T20 World Cup.[69] In the final, Williamson scored a brilliant knock of 85
      off 48 balls but ended up on the losing side after facing defeat to
      Australia by 8 wickets.[70] He was New Zealand's top scorer in the
      tournament with 216 runs at an average of 43.20.[71] Post-captaincy In
      December 2022, Williamson stepped down as New Zealand's Test captain,
      ahead of their tour to Pakistan.[72][73] In the first Test, he scored his
      fifth double century in Tests,[74] and became the first New Zealand batter
      to hit five double centuries in Test cricket.[75][76] He also became the
      first New Zealand batter to achieve the milestone of 25 century in Test
      cricket.[77] On 28 February 2023, Williamson surpassed Ross Taylor's tally
      of 7,683 runs to become New Zealand's highest run scorer in Test cricket,
      on the same day he also scored his 26th Test century against England in
      the second Test of the two match Test series.[78] On 18 March 2023,
      Williamson scored his 29th century in test cricket. He went on to turn the
      innings into his 6th test match double century. International centuries
