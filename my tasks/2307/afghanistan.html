    <h1>Afghanistan Team</h1>
    <p class="three">
      The Afghanistan men's national team (Pashto: د افغانستان کرکټ ملي
      لوب‌‌‌‌‌‌ډله, Persian: تیم ملی کریکت افغانستان) represents Afghanistan in
      international cricket. Cricket has been played in Afghanistan since the
      mid-19th century, but it was only in the early 21st century that the
      national team began to enjoy success. The Afghanistan Cricket Board was
      formed in 1995 and became an affiliate member of the International Cricket
      Council (ICC) in 2001[14] and a member of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC)
      in 2003.[15] After nearly a decade of playing international cricket, on 22
      June 2017, at an ICC meeting in London, full ICC Membership (and therefore
      Test status) was granted to Afghanistan. Alongside Ireland, this took the
      number of Test cricket playing nations to twelve. It is the first country
      to ever achieve Full Member status after holding Affiliate Membership of
      the ICC.[16][17] The team is ranked 10th in Twenty20 International (T20I)
      cricket as of February 2023,[18] and holds the world record for the
      highest ever T20I score, with their score of 278/3 against Ireland at
      Dehradun on 23 February 2019.

      In August 2021, concerns and doubts were raised over the participation of
      the Afghanistan national cricket team in the future international matches
      ever since Afghanistan was brought under the control of the
      Taliban.[19][20] Concerns were raised over the safety of Afghan national
      cricketers and their families who were still in Afghanistan during the
      Taliban takeover on 15 August 2021.[21] As of 31 August 2021, three of the
      Afghanistan women's national cricket team had evacuated to Canada, while
      the others were afraid of how they, as women, would be treated by the
      Taliban.[22] Taliban spokesmen stated that the Taliban would not disrupt
      the men's cricket team's participation in international matches and that
      they would allow Afghanistan to play its first ever bilateral series
      against Pakistan in Sri Lanka which was scheduled to start in September
      2021.[23][24] The Pakistan Cricket Board announced in August 2021 that the
      tour would be rescheduled to 2022. This was later moved to 2023 and the
      tour took place between 24 – 27 March 2023.[25] Despite the political
      turmoil, Afghanistan cricket team's media manager Hikmat Hassan confirmed
      that Afghanistan would participate in the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World
      Cup.[26] History Pre-ODI history The earliest record of cricket in
      Afghanistan is of British troops playing a match in Kabul in 1839, though
      it appears that no long lasting legacy of cricket was left by the British.
      In the 1990s, cricket became popular amongst the Afghan refugees residing
      in Pakistan, and the Afghanistan Cricket Board was formed there in 1995.
      They continued to play cricket on their return to their home country.[14]
      Like all sports, cricket was initially banned by the Taliban, but cricket
      became an exception in 2000 (being the only sport in Afghanistan to be
      approved by the Taliban) and the Afghanistan Cricket Federation was
      elected as an affiliate member of the ICC the following year.[27] The
      cricketing style, reflecting the background of development in refugee
      camps in Pakistan, is like the style characteristic of Pakistani
      cricketing practice generally, the emphasis on fast bowling and wrist spin
      for example. The national team was invited to play in the second tier of
      Pakistani domestic cricket the same year,[14] and the tour brought
      international media attention to Afghan cricket when the US-led invasion
      of the country began whilst the team was in Pakistan. The team lost three
      and drew two of the five matches on the tour.[27] Originally the Taliban
      regime in Afghanistan had banned cricket as they had banned most other
      sports, but in early 2000 there was a change of heart and the government
      wrote to the Pakistan Cricket Board asking for the PCB's support for an
      Afghan application to the ICC[citation needed]. The conflict in
      Afghanistan shortly afterwards led to a large number of Afghan refugees
      fleeing to Pakistan, where some learned to play cricket, and the presence
      of Pakistani peacekeeping troops in Afghanistan later helped this process.
      In 2001, the Afghan side took part in a four-match tour of Pakistan,
      visiting Peshawar and Rawalpindi, and the team also visited in 2003 and
      2004. In 2004 Afghanistan played in the Asian Cricket Council Trophy in
      Kuala Lumpur - the regional qualifying competition for the ICC Trophy -
      and performed respectably, with the highlight being a surprise win over
      hosts Malaysia. They played in two Pakistani tournaments in 2003, winning
      their first match that year. They began playing in Asian regional
      tournaments in 2004, finishing sixth in their first ACC Trophy. More
      success began in 2006 when they were runners-up to Bahrain in the Middle
      East Cup and beat an MCC side featuring former England captain Mike
      Gatting by 171 runs in Mumbai. Gatting was dismissed for a duck.[27] They
      toured England in the summer of 2006, winning six out of seven matches.
      Three of their wins came against the second XIs of Essex, Glamorgan and
      Leicestershire.[15] They finished third in the ACC Trophy that year,
      beating Nepal in a play-off match.[27] They won their first tournament in
      2007, sharing the ACC Twenty20 Cup with Oman after the two tied in the
      final.[27] They began their qualifying campaign for the 2011 World Cup in
      Jersey in 2008, winning Division Five of the World Cricket League.[28]
      They finished third in the ACC Trophy Elite tournament the same year,[15]
      and won a second consecutive WCL tournament, Division Four in Tanzania
      later in the year.[15] In January 2009, Afghanistan progressed to the 2009
      World Cup Qualifier by winning Division Three of the World Cricket League
      in Buenos Aires, topping the table on net run rate ahead of Uganda and
      Papua New Guinea.[29] ODI status The national team at Rotterdam, 2010 ICC
      WCL Division One In the 2011 Cricket World Cup qualifying tournament,
      Afghanistan failed to progress to the World Cup, but earned ODI status for
      four years.[15] Their first ODI was against Scotland in the 5th place
      playoff, having previously beaten the Scots earlier in the tournament;
      Afghanistan won by 89 runs.[30] In the Intercontinental Cup Afghanistan
      played its first first-class match against a Zimbabwe XI in a four-day
      match in Mutare. During the match, which was drawn, Afghan batsman Noor
      Ali scored centuries in both his innings, making him only the fourth
      player to do so on their first-class debut. Later, in August 2009, they
      played the Netherlands in same competition at the VRA Cricket Ground,
      winning a low-scoring match by one wicket.[31] Afghanistan then took part
      in the 2009 ACC Twenty20 Cup in the United Arab Emirates. Afghanistan were
      drawn in Group A, a group which Afghanistan topped at the end of the group
      stages by winning all five of their matches. In the semi-finals the
      Afghans defeated Kuwait by 8 wickets.[32] In the final they met the hosts,
      the United Arab Emirates, whom they defeated by 84 runs.[33] On 1 February
      2010, Afghanistan played their first Twenty20 International against
      Ireland,[34] which they lost by 5 wickets.[35] On 13 February 2010,
      Afghanistan defeated the United Arab Emirates by 4 wickets to make their
      way to the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 to be in the West Indies in April 2010.
      Later the same day they defeated Ireland by 8 wickets in the Final of 2010
      ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier to win the qualifier.[36] Afghanistan were in
      Group C of the main tournament, with India and South Africa. During their
      first match against India, opening batsman Noor Ali hit 50 runs, helping
      Afghanistan to a score of 115 in their 20 overs. Despite this they lost
      the match by 8 wickets.[37] In their second match, the team were reduced
      to 14/6 at one stage, before a late rally from Mirwais Ashraf and Hamid
      Hassan helped Afghanistan post 88 all out, resulting in a loss by 59
      runs.[38] The team's Intercontinental Cup campaign continued in 2010, with
      wins over Ireland, Canada, Scotland and Kenya before they beat Scotland by
      7 wickets in the final in Dubai.[39] Also in 2010, they won the ACC Trophy
      Elite tournament in Kuwait, beating Nepal in the final[40] and finished
      third in Division One of the World Cricket League in the Netherlands.[41]
      They took part in the cricket tournament at the 2010 Asian Games in China
      and won the silver medal, losing to Bangladesh in the final.[42] In 2011,
      Afghanistan begun the 2011-13 ICC World Cricket League Championship. They
      beat Canada and drew with the UAE.[43] In the parallel one-day league,
      they won two matches against Canada and lost twice to the UAE.[44] In
      December once again took part in the ACC Twenty20 Cup, this time in Nepal.
      They went on to win all of their matches to once again take the Cup. In
      2012 Afghanistan took on new levels of competition. They played their
      first One Day International against a Full Member of the International
      Cricket Council in February 2012 when they played a match against Pakistan
      at Sharjah. They also took on the Australia Cricket Team in an Only ODI at
      Sharjah in August 2012. They fell short in both matches, but their
      performance showed they were continuing to make progress. Their 2012 ICC
      International Cup games were also challenging, resulting in a split with
      the Netherlands and a loss to Ireland. 2013 brought greater success for
      Afghanistan. In March, they played two T20 Internationals against Scotland
      in UAE and prevailed in both matches. They also won two ODIs in the World
      Cricket League Championship against the same opponents. In the WCL
      Championship table, as 2013 dawned Afghanistan was level with Scotland in
      third, trailing Ireland and the Netherlands for the two automatic
      qualification spots for the 2015 World Cup. However, two convincing wins
      in spring over Scotland boosted hopes some. Then in July the Netherlands
      failed to take any points against Ireland, leaving Afghanistan in position
      to qualify if they could win their final four matches, against poorer
      performing Namibia and Kenya. Despite the United Arab Emirates and the
      Netherlands both being able to win their remaining games, keeping the
      pressure on Afghanistan, Afghanistan handled Namibia, then defeated Kenya
      by 8 wickets on 2 October. With one final win over Kenya on 4 October by 7
      wickets, Afghanistan secured second in the Championship with 19 points,
      and qualified for World Cup.[45] Afghanistan also crushed Scotland in
      their one-day ICC Intercontinental Cup league in March in Abu Dhabi:
      Afghanistan (275: Shah 67*, Davey 4–53) beat Scotland (125: Taylor 48*,
      Dawlatzai 6–57 and 145: Coetzer 57, Dawlatzai 5–37) by an innings and 5
      runs. Izatullah Dawlatzai took eleven wickets.[46] In July 2014
      Afghanistan toured Zimbabwe to play its 1st full series against a full
      member. The 4 match ODI series finished 2–2 and the 2 match first class
      series finished 1–1. With their victory over Zimbabwe on 25 December 2015,
      Afghanistan entered the top 10 of the ICC's ODI rankings for the first
      time.[47] Associate Membership Afghanistan had become an Affiliate member
      of the ICC in 2001. Then in 2009 it had attained one-day status until
      2015. They are currently developing their domestic cricket infrastructure,
      and have signed a two-year deal with the Pakistan board for the
      development of Afghanistan cricket ahead of the 2015 World Cup. In 2012,
      the Asian Cricket Council decided to nominate Afghanistan for Associate
      membership with the ICC, with the request being looked into at the ICC's
      annual conference in June. Becoming an Associate would mean higher funding
      (the ICC had been paying $700,000 in annual funding to Afghanistan's
      organization, suggested to rise to $850,000 for Associate status), and
      also importantly would mean more exposure for the passionate and
      cricket-starved players from war-torn Afghanistan.[48][49] In March 2013,
      Afghanistan received a further support boost when a two-year Memorandum of
      Understanding (MoU) was signed between the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB)
      and Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) for the development of Afghanistan
      cricket ahead of the 2015 World Cup. The PCB provided technical and
      professional support, including game-education programmes, coaching
      courses, skill and performance analysis, and basic umpiring and curator
      courses. High performance camps for emerging players were also organised.
      The PCB-regulated National Cricket Academy (NCA) helped in improving
      technical, tactical, mental and physical skills, and hosted lectures on
      doping, anti-corruption and various codes of conduct.[50] In April 2013,
      the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) was also allocated US$422,000
      (22,400,000 AFN approx.) from the ICC's targeted assistance and
      performance programme. The world governing body of cricket approved the
      grant at its IDI (ICC Development International) board meeting, which
      concluded in Dubai. The money, to be given over three years, was aimed at
      developing more competitive teams among ICC Full, Associate and Affiliate
      members. Previous countries to receive similar funding programmes included
      the Netherlands, Scotland, the West Indies, Zimbabwe and Ireland. An ICC
      statement suggested the funding was targeted towards the development of
      the National Cricket Academy in Kabul. On 26 June 2013 at the ICC's annual
      meeting in London, England, Afghanistan received its Associate
      Membership[51] with the statement: "Afghanistan is the only country that
      receives the Associate Membership in a short period of time in reward to
      the efforts Afghanistan made for the promotion of cricket," (Dr Noor
      Muhammad, CEO of the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB), on the ACC website)
      2015 Cricket World Cup Main article: Afghanistan at the Cricket World Cup
      Afghanistan made their World Cup debut in the 50 over format of the game
      against Bangladesh at the Manuka Oval in Canberra, Australia. The match
      resulted in a 105 run defeat.[52] The competition saw the team compete
      against elite cricketing nations such as Australia, India, Sri Lanka,
      South Africa, New Zealand and England. Qualification for the tournament
      was a historic feat for cricket in Afghanistan, one amplified by the fact
      that the team included many players who picked up the game in refugee
      camps outside their long-suffering country.[53] On 26 February 2015,
      Afghanistan won their first World Cup match against Scotland, winning by
      one wicket. The team however, lost all its remaining games and were
      knocked out of the tournament in the opening round. Post-World Cup tours
      The team visited Zimbabwe for the second time in October where Afghanistan
      clinched a historic one-day international series over Zimbabwe after a
      73-run victory in Bulawayo saw them win 3–2. Doing so, they became the
      first non-Test-playing country to win a multi-game bilateral ODI series
      against a Test side. The Afghanistan cricket team toured the United Arab
      Emirates to play the United Arab Emirates cricket team in December 2016.
      The tour consisted of three Twenty20 International (T20I) matches.
      Afghanistan won the series 3–0. The Afghanistan cricket team toured
      Bangladesh in September and October 2016 to play three One Day
      Internationals (ODIs) matches. This was Afghanistan's first full series
      against a Test-playing side other than Zimbabwe and was the first
      bilateral series between the two sides. Ahead of the ODI series there was
      a fifty-over warm-up game between the Bangladesh Cricket Board XI and
      Afghanistan in Fatullah. Afghanistan won the warm-up match by 66 runs and
      Bangladesh won the ODI series 2–1. In February 2017 the International
      Cricket Council (ICC) awarded first-class status to Afghanistan's four-day
      domestic competition.[54] The Afghan cricket team toured Zimbabwe between
      January and February 2017. The tour consisted of five One Day
      International(ODI) matches. Prior to the ODI series, the Afghanistan A
      cricket team played five "unofficial" ODI matches against the Zimbabwe A
      cricket team. All of those matches had been designated List A status.
      Afghanistan won the initial List A series 4–1 and the ODI series 3–2. 2017
      The Ireland cricket team toured India during March 2017 to participate in
      a series of matches against Afghanistan, consisting of three T20 matches,
      five ODI contests and an ICC Intercontinental Cup match.[55] All the
      matches took place in Greater Noida. The Afghan team were highly
      successful, emerging victorious in both the T20I series 3–0 and the ODI
      series 3–2. Afghanistan also won the ICC Intercontinental Cup match, by
      the margin of an innings and 172 runs. The Afghanistan cricket team
      completed another tour in June 2017, this time facing the West Indies.[56]
      The tour marked Afghanistan's first bilateral tour against a full member
      nation other than Zimbabwe. (Later that month, Afghanistan itself was
      awarded that status). The tour was less successful for the Afghans, who
      were convincingly defeated 3–0 in the T20 series.[57] They performed
      better in the ODI series, seizing a 1–1 draw after the final match was
      washed out with no result. Afghanistan registered their first win against
      Sri Lanka in Asia Cup.
