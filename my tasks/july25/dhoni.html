        Born in Ranchi, Bihar (now in Jharkhand),[8][9] His exceptional
        wicketkeeping skills allowed him to become the regular wicketkeeper at
        the Commando Cricket Club (1995–1998), he was picked for the 1997/98
        season Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-16 Championship, where he performed
        well.[10] From 2001 to 2003, He worked as a Travelling Ticket Examiner
        at Kharagpur railway station under South Eastern Railway in Midnapore,
        in West Bengal.[11][12] In Indian domestic cricket he played for Bihar
        and then for Jharkhand Cricket team. Dhoni's performance in the 2002–03
        season included three half-centuries in the Ranji Trophy and a couple of
        half-centuries in the Deodhar Trophy, as he started gaining recognition
        for his lower-order contribution as well as hard-hitting batting style.
        Dhoni made his ODI debut on 23 December 2004, against Bangladesh in
        Chittagong,[13] and played his first Test a year later against Sri
        Lanka.[14] He played his first T20I also a year later against South
        Africa.[15] In 2007, he took over the ODI captaincy from Rahul Dravid
        and he also selected as T20I captain of India in this year.[16] In 2008,
        he was selected as Test captain.[17] His captaincy record in Tests
        format was mixed, successfully leading India to a series win against New
        Zealand in 2008 and the Border-Gavaskar Trophy (home series in 2010 and
        2013) against Australia.[18] In other formats, Dhoni is the first
        cricketer to be a winning captain of all three major ICC trophies, as
        under his captaincy, India won the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, the 2011
        Cricket World Cup, and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, the most by any
        captain. He also led India to victory in the 2010 and 2016 Asia Cup.
        Additionally, under his leadership, India won the 2010 and 2011 ICC Test
        Mace and 2013 ICC ODI Championship. He has scored 17,266 runs in
        International Cricket (including 10,000 plus runs in ODI
        Internationals). He is the captain of Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in the
        Indian Premier League, leading them to the final on 10 occasions and
        winning in the 2010, 2011, 2018, 2021 and 2023 editions of the league,
        as well as winning the Champions League T20 two times, in 2010 and 2014.
        He is the 7th cricketer have scored more than 5,000 runs in the IPL, as
        well as being the first wicket-keeper to do so. Dhoni received India's
        highest sports honour, the Major Dhyanchand Khel Ratna Award in 2008 for
        his outstanding achievements and the Government of India honoured him
        India's fourth civilian award Padma Shri in 2009 and third civilian
        award Padma Bhushan in 2018. He is the only cricket captain in the world
        to win all three of the Cricket World Cup, ICC Men's T20 World Cup and
        ICC Champions Trophy. Dhoni holds an honorary rank of Lieutenant Colonel
        in the Parachute Regiment of the Indian Territorial Army,[19] it was
        presented to him by the Indian Army in 2011 for his service to the
        nation as a cricketer.[20] Dhoni is considered one of the most popular
        cricketers in the world.[21] He is a leading brand endorser celebrity in
        India. The 2016 film, M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story was made as a biopic
        on his life. He announced his retirement from Tests on 30 December
        2014,[22] and stepped down as captain of T20Is and ODIs in 2017. On 15
        August 2020, Dhoni retired from all formats of international cricket and
        continues to play in the IPL.[23][24] Early life and background Dhoni
        was born in Ranchi, Bihar (now in Jharkhand) and hails from a Hindu
        Rajput family to parents from Uttarakhand.[25][26] He is the youngest of
        three children of Pan Singh and Devaki Devi.[27][28][29][10] His
        paternal village Lwali, is in Jainti Tehsil, Lamgara block of the Almora
        District of Uttarakhand.[30] His parents moved from Uttarakhand to
        Ranchi, Jharkhand where his father worked as a pump operator in junior
        management position in MECON Colony situated in Doranda area in
        Ranchi.[31] Unlike Dhoni, his uncle and cousins spell their surname
        "Dhauni".[30] Previously Dhoni was the goalkeeper for his DAV Jawahar
        Vidya Mandir school's football team,[32] but after seeing his
        goalkeeping skills, coach Keshav Ranjan Banerjee, one who inspired Dhoni
        to be a cricketer, picked him to play cricket for his school team.[33]
        His exceptional wicketkeeping skills allowed him to become the regular
        wicketkeeper at the Commando Cricket Club (1995–1998). Based on his
        performance at club cricket, he was picked for the 1997/98 season Vinoo
        Mankad Trophy Under-16 Championship, where he performed well.[10] From
        2001 to 2003, Dhoni worked as a Travelling Ticket Examiner (TTE) at
        Kharagpur railway station under South Eastern Railway in Midnapore (W),
        a district in West Bengal.[34][35] Early career Junior cricket in Bihar
        In 1998, Dhoni was selected by Deval Sahay, a former Bihar Cricket
        Association Vice President and Ranchi District Cricket President, to
        play for the Central Coal Fields Limited (CCL) team.[36] Till 1998
        Dhoni, who was in 12th grade, had never played professional cricket. At
        CCL, he got an opportunity to bat higher up the order, where he
        performed exceptionally, which had helped CCL move to the A
        division.[37] Deval Sahay, impressed by his performance, pushed for his
        selection in the Bihar team.[38] Dhoni moved to the Ranchi team, the
        junior Bihar cricket team and eventually the senior Bihar Ranji Team
        within one year.[39][40] In the 1998–99 Cooch Behar Trophy, Dhoni played
        for the U-19 Bihar team and scored 176 runs in 5 matches (7 innings).
        However, Bihar finished fourth in the group of six and did not make it
        to the quarter-finals. Dhoni was not picked for the East Zone U-19 squad
        (CK Nayudu Trophy) or Rest of India squad (MA Chidambaram Trophy and
        Vinoo Mankad Trophy). In the 1999–2000 Cooch Behar Trophy, the Bihar
        U-19 cricket team made it to the finals, where Dhoni's 84 helped Bihar
        post a total of 357.[41] Nevertheless, Bihar's efforts were thwarted by
        Punjab's 839 with Dhoni's future teammate Yuvraj Singh making
        358.[42][43] Dhoni's contribution in the tournament included 488 runs (9
        matches, 12 innings), 5 fifties, 17 catches and 7 stumpings.[44] Dhoni
        made it to the East Zone U-19 squad for the CK Nayudu trophy in the
        1999–2000 season but scored only 97 runs in four matches, as East Zone
        lost all four matches and finished last in the tournament.[45][46][47]
        Bihar cricket team Further information: 2001–02 Ranji Trophy Dhoni made
        his Ranji Trophy debut for Bihar in the 1999–2000 season, as an
        eighteen-year-old. He made a half century in his debut match scoring 68*
        in the second innings against Assam cricket team.[48] Dhoni finished the
        season with 283 runs in 5 matches. Dhoni scored his maiden first-class
        century while playing for Bihar against Bengal in the 2000/01
        season.[49] Apart from this century, his performance in the 2000/01
        season[50] did not include another score over fifty and in the 2001/02
        season, he scored just five fifties in four Ranji matches.[51] Jharkhand
        cricket team Dhoni's performance in the 2002–03 season included three
        half-centuries in the Ranji Trophy and a couple of half-centuries in the
        Deodhar Trophy, as he started gaining recognition for his lower-order
        contribution as well as hard-hitting batting style. In the 2003/04
        season, Dhoni scored a century (128*) against Assam in the first match
        of the Ranji ODI tournament. Dhoni was part of the East Zone squad that
        won the Deodhar Trophy 2003–2004 season[52][53] and contributed with 244
        runs in 4 matches,[54] including a century (114) against Central
        zone.[55] In the Duleep Trophy finals, Dhoni was picked over
        international cricketer Deep Dasgupta to represent East Zone.[56] He
        scored a fighting half-century in the second innings in a losing
        cause.[57] Dhoni's talent was discovered via the BCCI's small-town
        talent-spotting initiative TRDW. Dhoni was discovered by TRDO[58]
        Prakash Poddar, captain of Bengal in the 1960s, when he saw Dhoni play
        for Jharkhand at a match in Jamshedpur in 2003, and sent a report to the
        National Cricket Academy.[59] India A team He was recognised for his
        efforts in the 2003/04 season, especially in the One Day format and was
        picked for the India A squad for a tour of Zimbabwe and Kenya.[60]
        Against the Zimbabwe XI in Harare Sports Club, Dhoni had his best
        wicket-keeping effort with 7 catches and 4 stumpings in the match.[61]
        In the tri-nation tournament involving Kenya, India A and Pakistan A,
        Dhoni helped India A chase down their target of 223 against Pakistan A
        with a half-century.[62] Continuing his good performance, he scored back
        to back centuries – 120[63] and 119*[64] – against the same team. Dhoni
        scored 362 runs in 6 innings at an average of 72.40 and his performance
        in the series received attention from the then Indian captain – Sourav
        Ganguly[65] and Ravi Shastri, amongst others. International career Start
        of ODI career The Indian ODI team in the early 2000s saw Rahul Dravid as
        the wicket-keeper to ensure that the wicket-keeper spot didn't lack in
        batting talent.[65] The team also saw the entry of wicket-keeper/batsmen
        from the junior ranks, with talents like Parthiv Patel and Dinesh
        Karthik (both India U-19 captains) named in the Test squads.[65] With
        Dhoni making a mark in the India A squad, he was picked in the ODI squad
        for the Bangladesh tour in 2004/05.[66] Dhoni did not have a great start
        to his ODI career, getting run out for a duck on debut.[67] In spite of
        an average series against Bangladesh, Dhoni was picked for the Pakistan
        ODI series.[68] Breakthrough In the second match of the series, Dhoni,
        in his fifth one-day international, scored 148 in Visakhapatnam off only
        123 deliveries. Dhoni's 148 surpassed the earlier record for the highest
        score by an Indian wicket-keeper,[69] a record that he would re-write
        before the end of the year. Dhoni had few batting opportunities in the
        first two games of the Sri Lankan bilateral ODI series (October–November
        2005) and was promoted to No. 3 in the third ODI at Sawai Mansingh
        Stadium (Jaipur). Sri Lanka had set India a target of 299 after a Kumar
        Sangakkara century and, in reply, India lost Tendulkar early. Dhoni was
        promoted to accelerate the scoring and ended the game with an unbeaten
        183 off 145 balls, winning the game for India.[70] The innings was
        described in Wisden Almanack (2006) as 'Uninhibited, yet anything but
        crude'.[71] The innings set various records including the highest
        individual score in ODI cricket in the second innings,[72] a record only
        broken after seven years by Shane Watson.[73] Dhoni ended the series
        with the highest run aggregate (346)[74] and was awarded the Man of the
        Series award for his efforts. In December 2005, Dhoni was rewarded a
        B-grade contract by the BCCI.[75]
