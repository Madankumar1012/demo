      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing
      the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML
      or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a
      cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
      JavaScript.[2] CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and
      presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can
      improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the
      specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages
      to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css
      file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content;
      and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed
      between the pages that share the file and its formatting. Separation of
      formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup
      page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as
      on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader),
      and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate
      formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4] The name
      cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which
      style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element.
      This cascading priority scheme is predictable. The CSS specifications are
      maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type
      (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March
      1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS
      documents.[5] In addition to HTML,Separation of formatting and content
      also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles
      for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice
      (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile
      devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is
      accessed on a mobile device.[4] The name cascading comes from the
      specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more
      than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme
      is predictable. The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide
      Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is
      registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a
      free CSS validation service for CSS documents.[5] other markup languages
      support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL. CSS is
      also used in GTK widget toolkit.

    <h1 id="block">Declaration block</h1>
    <p class="vinay">
      A declaration block consists of a list of declarations in braces. Each
      declaration itself consists of a property, a colon (:), and a value. If
      there are multiple declarations in a block, a semi-colon (;) must be
      inserted to separate each declaration. An optional semi-colon after the
      last (or single) declaration may be used. Optional white-space may be
      around the declaration block, declarations, colons, and semi-colons for
      readability.[9] Properties are specified in the CSS standard. Each
      property has a set of possible values. Some properties can affect any type
      of element, and others apply only to particular groups of
      elements.[10][11] Values may be keywords, such as "center" or "inherit",
      or numerical values, such as 200px (200 pixels), 50vw (50 percent of the
      viewport width) or 80% (80 percent of the parent element's width). Color
      values can be specified with keywords (e.g. "red"), hexadecimal values
      (e.g. #FF0000, also abbreviated as #F00), RGB values on a 0 to 255 scale
      (e.g. rgb(255, 0, 0)), RGBA values that specify both color and alpha
      transparency (e.g. rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.8)), or HSL or HSLA values (e.g.
      hsl(000, 100%, 50%), hsla(000, 100%, 50%, 80%)).[12] Length units Non-zero
      numeric values representing linear measures must include a length unit,
      which is either an alphabetic code or abbreviation, as in 200px or 50vw;
      or a percentage sign, as in 80%. Some units m (centimetre); in (inch); mm
      (millimetre); pc (pica); and pt (point) are absolute, which means that the
      rendered dimension does not depend upon the structure of the page; others
      â€“ em (em); ex (ex) and px (pixel)[clarification needed] are relative,
      which means that factors such as the font size of a parent element can
      affect the rendered measurement. These eight units were a feature of CSS
      1[13] and retained in all subsequent revisions. The proposed CSS Values
      and Units Module Level 3 will, if adopted as a W3C Recommendation, provide
      seven further length units: ch; Q; rem; vh; vmax; vmin; and vw.[14] Use
      Before CSS, nearly all presentational attributes of HTML documents were
      contained within the HTML markup. All font colors, background styles,
      element alignments, borders, and sizes had to be explicitly described,
      often repeatedly, within the HTML. CSS lets authors move much of that
      information to another file, the style sheet, resulting in considerably
      simpler HTML. For example, headings (h1 elements), sub-headings (h2),
      sub-sub-headings (h3), etc., are defined structurally using HTML. In print
      and on the screen, choice of font, size, color and emphasis for these
      elements is presentational. Before CSS, document authors who wanted to
      assign such typographic characteristics to, say, all h2 headings had to
      repeat HTML presentational markup for each occurrence of that heading
      type. This made documents more complex, larger, and more error-prone and
      difficult to maintain. CSS allows the separation of presentation from
      structure. CSS can define color, font, text alignment, size, borders,
      spacing, layout and many other typographic characteristics, and can do so
      independently for on-screen and printed views. CSS also defines non-visual
      styles, such as reading speed and emphasis for aural text readers. The W3C
      has now deprecated the use of all presentational HTML markup.[15] For
      example, under pre-CSS HTML, a heading element defined with red text would
      be written as: Using CSS, the same element can be coded using style
      properties instead of HTML presentational attributes:
