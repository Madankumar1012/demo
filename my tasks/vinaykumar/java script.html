      Brendan Eich born July 4, 1961erican computer programmer and technology
      executive. He created the JavaScript programming language and co-founded
      the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation.
      He served as the Mozilla Corporation's chief technical officer before he
      was appointed chief executive officer, but resigned shortly after his
      appointment due to pressure over his firm opposition to same-sex marriage.
      He subsequently became the CEO of Brave Software. Early life Eich grew up
      in Pittsburgh; Gaithersburg, Maryland; and Palo Alto,[2] and he attended
      Ellwood P. Cubberley High School, graduating in the class of 1979. He
      received his bachelor's degree in mathematics and computer science at
      Santa Clara University,[2] and he received his master's degree in 1985
      from the University of Illinois at Urbanaampaign.[2] Eich is Roman
      Catholic.[1] He began his career at Silicon Graphics, working for seven
      years on operating system and network code.[3] He then worked for three
      years at MicroUnity Systems Engineering writing microkernel n March 24,
      2014, Mozilla made the decision to appoint Eich as CEO of Mozilla
      Corporation.[10][11][12] The appointment triggered widespread criticism
      due to Eich's past political donations[10][13][14][15] – specifically, a
      2008 donation of $1,000 to California Proposition 8, which called for the
      banning of same-sex marriage in California,[16] and donations in the
      amount of $2,100 to Proposition 8 supporter Tom McClintock between 2008
      and 2010.[17] The Wall Street Journal initially reported that, in protest
      against his coming appointment, half of Mozilla's board (Gary Kovacs, John
      Lilly, and Ellen Siminoff) stepped down,[18][19][20][21] leaving Mitchell
      Baker, Reid Hoffman, and Katharina Borchert.[22] CNET later reported that
      of the three board members who had left, only Lilly left due to Eich's
      appointment.[22] Lilly told The New York Times, "I left rather than
      appoint him", and declined to elaborate further.[23] On March 26, 2014,
      Eich expressed "sorrow for causing pain" and pledged to "work with LGBT
      communities and allies" at Mozilla.[18][17] Some of the activists created
      an online campaign against Eich, with online dating site OkCupid
      automatically displaying a message to Firefox users with information about
      Eich's donation, and suggesting that users switch to a different browser
      (although giving them a link to continue with Firefox).[24][25][26] CREDO
      Mobile collected more than 50,000 signatures demanding that Eich
      resign.[12][27] After 11 days as CEO, Eich resigned on April 3, 2014, and
      left Mozilla over his opposition to same-sex marriage.[28][29][30] In his
      personal blog, he posted, "under the present circumstances, I cannot be an
      effective leader".[31][32] Mozilla made a press release saying that board
      members tried to get Eich to stay in the company in a different role, but
      that he had chosen to sever ties for the time being.[33]and DSP

      Netscape Eich started work at Netscape Communications Corporation in April
      1995. Eich originally joined intending to put Scheme "in the browser",[4]
      but his Netscape superiors insisted that the language's syntax resemble
      that of Java. As a result, Eich devised a language that had much of the
      functionality of Scheme, the object-orientation of Self, and the syntax of
      Java. He completed the first version in ten days in order to accommodate
      the Navigator 2.0 Beta release schedule,[4][5] and was called Mocha, but
      renamed LiveScript in September 1995 and finally in a joint announcement
      with Sun Microsystems it was named JavaScript in December.[6]
      Simultaneously, he designed the first SpiderMonkey engine for the Netscape
      Navigator browser at Netscape Communications. When Mozilla inherited the
      Netscape base code in 1998, it included this engine, which was written in
      the C programming language.[7] It was then changed in JavaScript 1.5 to
      comply with the ECMA-262 standard.[citation needed] Eich continued to
      oversee the development of SpiderMonkey, the specific implementation of
      JavaScript in Navigator.[7] Mozilla In early 1998, Eich co-founded the
      free and open-source software project Mozilla with Jamie Zawinski and
      others, creating the mozilla.org website, which was meant to manage
      open-source contributions to the Netscape source code. He served as
      Mozilla's chief architect.[8] AOL bought Netscape in 1999. After AOL shut
      down the Netscape browser unit in July 2003, Eich helped spin out the
      Mozilla Foundation.[9] In August 2005, after serving as a lead
      technologist and as a member of the board of directors of the Mozilla
      Foundation, Eich became chief technical officer (CTO) of the newly founded
      Mozilla Corporation, meant to be the Mozilla Foundation's for-profit
      arm.[9] Eich continued to "own" the Mozilla SpiderMonkey module, its
      JavaScript engine until he passed on the ownership of it to Dave Mandolin
      in 2011.[7] Appointment to CEO and resignation On March 24, 2014, Mozilla
      made the decision to appoint Eich as CEO of Mozilla
      Corporation.[10][11][12] The appointment triggered widespread criticism
      due to Eich's past political donations[10][13][14][15] – specifically, a

      that he had chosen to sever ties for the time being.[33] Brave Software
      Eich is the CEO of Brave Software, an Internet browser platform company
      that raised $2.5 million in early funding from angel investors.[34] In
      January 2016, the company released developer versions of its open-source,
      Chromium-based and privacy-focused Brave web browser,[35] which blocks ads
      and trackers,[36][37] and features built-in Tor-connected tabs. At Brave
      Software, Eich co-created the Basic Attention Token (BAT), a
      cryptocurrency designed for use in the Brave browser. BAT launched its ICO
      on May 31, 2017, and raised $35 million.[38]
