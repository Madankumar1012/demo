        Facebook is a social networking website that was founded in February
        2004 by Harvard University students Chris Hughes, Andrew McCollum,
        Dustin Moskovitz, Eduardo Saverin and Mark Zuckerberg. The idea behind
        Facebook was to provide an online book of faces for university students
        to connect and share information

        Instagram[a] is a photo and video sharing social networking service
        owned by American company Meta Platforms. The app allows users to upload
        media that can be edited with filters, be organized by hashtags, and be
        associated with a location — via geographical tagging. Posts can be
        shared publicly or with preapproved followers. Users can browse other
        users' content by tags and locations, view trending content, like
        photos, and follow other users to add their content to a personal
        feed.[7] Instagram was originally distinguished by allowing content to
        be framed only in a square (1:1) aspect ratio of 640 pixels to match the
        display width of the iPhone at the time. In 2015, this restriction was
        eased with an increase to 1080 pixels. It also added messaging features,
        the ability to include multiple images or videos in a single post, and a
        Stories feature—similar to its main competitor Snapchat—which allowed
        users to post their content to a sequential feed, with each post
        accessible to others for 24 hours. As of January 2019, Stories is used
        by 500 million people daily.[7] Originally launched for iOS in October
        2010 by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, Instagram rapidly gained
        popularity, with one million registered users in two months, 10 million
        in a year, and 1 billion by June 2018.[8] In April 2012, Facebook Inc.
        acquired the service for approximately US$1 billion in cash and stock.
        The Android version was released in April 2012, followed by a
        feature-limited desktop interface in November 2012, a Fire OS app in
        June 2014, and an app for Windows 10 in October 2016. As of October
        2015, over 40 billion photos had been uploaded. Although often admired
        for its success and influence, Instagram has also been criticized for
        negatively affecting teens' mental health, its policy and interface
        changes, its alleged censorship, and illegal and inappropriate content
        uploaded by users. History For a chronological guide, see Timeline of
        Instagram. Instagram icon from 2016 to 2022, when it was updated to
        include even more saturated colors Instagram began development in San
        Francisco as Burbn, a mobile check-in app created by Kevin Systrom and
        Mike Krieger.[9] Realizing that it was too similar to Foursquare, they
        refocused their app on photo-sharing, which had become a popular feature
        among its users.[10][11] They renamed it Instagram, a portmanteau of
        "instant camera" and "telegram".[12] 2010–2011: Beginnings and major
        funding On March 5, 2010, Systrom closed a $500,000 seed funding round
        with Baseline Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz while working on
        Burbn.[13] Josh Riedel joined the company in October as Community
        Manager,[14] Shayne Sweeney joined in November as an engineer,[14] and
        Jessica Zollman joined as a Community Evangelist in August 2011.[14][15]
        The first Instagram post was a photo of South Beach Harbor at Pier 38,
        posted by Mike Krieger at 5:26 p.m. on July 16, 2010.[16][11] Systrom
        shared his first post, a picture of a dog and his girlfriend's foot, a
        few hours later at 9:24 p.m. It has been wrongly attributed as the first
        Instagram photo due to the earlier letter of the alphabet in its
        URL.[17][18][better source needed] On October 6, 2010, the Instagram iOS
        app was officially released through the App Store.[19] In February 2011,
        it was reported that Instagram had raised $7 million in Series A funding
        from a variety of investors, including Benchmark Capital, Jack Dorsey,
        Chris Sacca (through Capital fund), and Adam D'Angelo.[20] The deal
        valued Instagram at around $20 million.[21] In April 2012, Instagram
        raised $50 million from venture capitalists with a $500 million
        valuation.[22] Joshua Kushner was the second largest investor in
        Instagram's Series B fundraising round, leading his investment firm,
        Thrive Capital, to double its money after the sale to Facebook.[23]
        2012–2014: Additional platforms and acquisition by Facebook On April 3,
        2012, Instagram released a version of its app for Android
        phones,[24][25] and it was downloaded more than one million times in
        less than one day.[26] The Android app has since received two
        significant updates: first, in March 2014, which cut the file size of
        the app by half and added performance improvements;[27][28] then in
        April 2017, to add an offline mode that allows users to view and
        interact with content without an Internet connection. At the time of the
        announcement, it was reported that 80% of Instagram's 600 million users
        were located outside the U.S., and while the aforementioned
        functionality was live at its announcement, Instagram also announced its
        intention to make more features available offline, and that they were
        "exploring an iOS version".[29][30][31] On April 9, 2012, Facebook, Inc.
        (now Meta Platforms) bought Instagram for $1 billion in cash and
        stock,[32][33][34] with a plan to keep the company independently
        managed.[35][36][37] Britain's Office of Fair Trading approved the deal
        on August 14, 2012,[38] and on August 22, 2012, the Federal Trade
        Commission in the U.S. closed its investigation, allowing the deal to
        proceed.[39] On September 6, 2012, the deal between Instagram and
        Facebook officially closed with a purchase price of $300 million in cash
        and 23 million shares of stock.[40] The deal closed just before
        Facebook's scheduled initial public offering according to CNN.[37] The
        deal price was compared to the $35 million Yahoo! paid for Flickr in
        2005.[37] Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook was "committed to building and
        growing Instagram independently."[37] According to Wired, the deal
        netted Systrom $400 million.[41] In November 2012, Instagram launched
        website profiles, allowing anyone to see user feeds from a web browser
        with limited functionality,[42] as well as a selection of badges, web
        widget buttons to link to profiles.[43] Since the app's launch it had
        used the Foursquare API technology to provide named location tagging. In
        March 2014, Instagram started to test and switch the technology to use
        Facebook Places.[44][45] 2015–2017: Redesign and Windows app Instagram
        headquarters in Menlo Park In June 2015, the desktop website user
        interface was redesigned to become more flat and minimalistic, but with
        more screen space for each photo and to resemble the layout of
        Instagram's mobile website.[46][47][48] Furthermore, one row of pictures
        only has three instead of five photos to match the mobile layout. The
        slideshow banner[49][50] on the top of profile pages, which
        simultaneously slide-showed seven picture tiles of pictures posted by
        the user, alternating at different times in a random order, has been
        removed. In addition, the formerly angular profile pictures became
        circular. In April 2016, Instagram released a Windows 10 Mobile app,
        after years of demand from Microsoft and the public to release an app
        for the platform.[51][52] The platform previously had a beta version of
        Instagram, first released on November 21, 2013, for Windows Phone
        8.[53][54][55] The new app added support for videos (viewing and
        creating posts or stories, and viewing live streams), album posts and
        direct messages.[56] Similarly, an app for Windows 10 personal computers
        and tablets was released in October 2016.[57][58] In May, Instagram
        updated its mobile website to allow users to upload photos, and to add a
        "lightweight" version of the Explore tab.[59][60] On May 11, 2016,
        Instagram revamped its design, adding a black-and-white flat design
        theme for the app's user interface, and a less skeuomorphistic, more
        abstract, "modern" and colorful icon.[61][62][63] Rumors of a redesign
        first started circulating in April, when The Verge received a screenshot
        from a tipster, but at the time, an Instagram spokesperson simply told
        the publication that it was only a concept.[64] On December 6, 2016,
        Instagram introduced comment liking. However, unlike post likes, the
        user who posted a comment does not receive notifications about comment
        likes in their notification inbox. Uploaders can optionally decide to
        deactivate comments on a post.[65][66][67] The mobile web front end
        allows uploading pictures since May 4, 2017. Image filters and the
        ability to upload videos were not introduced then.[68][69] On April 30,
        2019, the Windows 10 Mobile app was discontinued, though the mobile
        website remains available as a progressive web application (PWA) with
        limited functionality. The app remains available on Windows 10 computers
        and tablets, also updated to a PWA in 2020. 2018–2019: IGTV, removal of
        the like counter, management changes To comply with the GDPR regulations
        regarding data portability, Instagram introduced the ability for users
        to download an archive of their user data in April 2018.[70][71][72]
        IGTV launched on June 20, 2018, as a standalone video application. On
        September 24, 2018, Krieger and Systrom announced in a statement they
        would be stepping down from Instagram.[73][74] On October 1, 2018, it
        was announced that Adam Mosseri would be the new head of
        Instagram.[75][76][77] During Facebook F8, it was announced that
        Instagram would, beginning in Canada, pilot the removal of publicly
        displayed "like" counts for content posted by other users.[78] Like
        counts would only be visible to the user who originally posted the
        content. Mosseri stated that this was intended to have users "worry a
        little bit less about how many likes they're getting on Instagram and
        spend a bit more time connecting with the people that they care
        about."[79][80] It has been argued that low numbers of likes in
        relativity to others could contribute to a lower self-esteem in
        users.[80][78] The pilot began in May 2019, and was extended to 6 other
        markets in July.[80][81] The pilot was expanded worldwide in November
        2019.[82] Also in July 2019, Instagram announced that it would implement
        new features designed to reduce harassment and negative comments on the
        service.[83] In August 2019, Instagram also began to pilot the removal
        of the "Following" tab from the app, which had allowed users to view a
        feed of the likes and comments made by users they follow. The change was
        made official in October, with head of product Vishal Shah stating that
        the feature was underused and that some users were "surprised" when they
        realized their activity was being surfaced in this manner.[84][85] In
        October 2019, Instagram introduced a limit on the number of posts
        visible in page scrolling mode unless logged in. Until this point,
        public profiles had been available to all users, even when not logged
        in. Following the change, after viewing a number of posts a pop-up
        requires the user to log in to continue viewing content.[86][87][88]
