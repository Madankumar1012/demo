        spent 20 years combined at Yahoo. WhatsApp joined Facebook in 2014, but
        continues to operate as a separate app with a laser focus on building a
        messaging service that works fast and reliably anywhere in the world.

      WhatsApp (also called WhatsApp Messenger) is a freeware, cross-platform,
      centralized instant messaging (IM) and voice-over-IP (VoIP) service owned
      by United States tech conglomerate Meta Platforms.[14] It allows users to
      send text, voice messages and video messages, [15] make voice and video
      calls, and share images, documents, user locations, and other
      content.[16][17] WhatsApp's client application runs on mobile devices, and
      can be accessed from computers.[18] The service requires a cellular mobile
      telephone number to sign up.[19] In January 2018, WhatsApp released a
      standalone business app called WhatsApp Business which can communicate
      with the standard WhatsApp client.[20][21] The service was created by
      WhatsApp Inc. of Mountain View, California, which was acquired by Facebook
      in February 2014 for approximately US$19.3 billion.[22][23] It became the
      world's most popular messaging application by 2015,[24][25] and had more
      than 2 billion users worldwide by February 2020.[26] By 2016, it had
      become the primary means of Internet communication in regions including
      Latin America, the Indian subcontinent, and large parts of Europe and
      Africa.[24] History For a chronological guide, see Timeline of WhatsApp.
      WhatsApp Timeline Feb 24, 2009 Jan Koum incorporates WhatsApp in
      California.[27] Aug 2009 WhatsApp 2.0 is released on the App Store for the
      iPhone.[28] Oct 2009 Brian Acton persuades five ex-Yahoo! friends to
      invest $250,000 in seed funding, and is granted co-founder status.[27] Aug
      2010 WhatsApp support for Android OS is added.[29] Jan 21, 2011 WeChat, a
      messenger app, is founded.[30] It eventually starts to compete with
      WhatsApp and becomes very popular in China. Apr 2011 In Series A round,
      WhatsApp founders agree to take $7 million from Sequoia Capital on top of
      their $250,000 seed funding, after months of negotiation with Sequoia
      partner Jim Goetz.[27] May 2011 Snapchat, a competing photo messaging app,
      is founded.[31] Jan 6, 2012 An unknown hacker publishes a website that
      makes it possible to change the status of an arbitrary WhatsApp user, as
      long as the phone number was known.[32][33] Aug 2012 The WhatsApp support
      staff announce that messages were encrypted in the "latest version" of the
      WhatsApp software for iOS and Android (but not BlackBerry, Windows Phone,
      and Symbian), without specifying the cryptographic method.[34] Feb 2013
      WhatsApp's user base grows to about 200 million active users and its staff
      to 50.[27] Jul 2013 Sequoia invests another $50 million in Series B round,
      valuing WhatsApp at $1.5 billion.[35] Jul 16, 2013 WhatsApp changes its
      profit model with an annual subscription fee of $1 after a free first
      year.[36][37] Aug 2013 Telegram, a cloud-based instant messaging service,
      launches.[38] Aug 2013 WhatsApp introduces voice messaging.[39] Feb 19,
      2014 Facebook, Inc. announces its acquisition of WhatsApp for US$19
      billion, its largest acquisition to date.[40] Facebook pays $4 billion in
      cash, $12 billion in Facebook shares, and an additional $3 billion in
      restricted stock units granted to WhatsApp's founders.[41] Mar 2014
      Someone discovers a vulnerability in WhatsApp encryption on the Android
      application that allows another app to access and read all of a user’s
      chat conversations within it.[42] Nov 2014 WhatsApp introduces Read
      Receipts, which show when a message is read by a recipient. Within a week,
      WhatsApp introduces an update allowing users to disable this feature.[43]
      Jan 21, 2015 WhatsApp launches WhatsApp Web, a web client which can be
      used through a web browser by syncing with the mobile device's
      connection.[44] Jan 21, 2015 WhatsApp announces its policy on cracking
      down on 3rd-party clients, including WhatsApp+.[45] Users would not be
      able to use WhatsApp’s services at all until the third-party apps are
      uninstalled.[46] Dec 2015 WhatsApp is briefly shut down in Brazil after it
      refuses to place wiretaps on certain WhatsApp accounts.[47] It is shut
      down in Brazil again on May 2016 and in July 2016.[48] Jan 18, 2016 Jan
      Koum announces that WhatsApp will no longer charge its users a $1 annual
      subscription fee.[49][50] There is still no clear plan for monetizing
      WhatsApp.[51] Mar 2016 Diego Dzodan, a Facebook executive, is arrested by
      Brazilian federal police after Facebook fails to turn over information
      from his WhatsApp messaging account into a judge's request for a drug
      trafficking investigation.[52][53] Mar 2, 2016 WhatsApp introduces its
      document-sharing feature, initially allowing users to share PDF files with
      their contacts.[54] Apr 5, 2016 WhatsApp and Open Whisper Systems announce
      that they have added end-to-end encryption to "every form of
      communication" on WhatsApp, and that users could now verify each other's
      keys.[55][56][57] May 10, 2016 WhatsApp is introduced for both Windows and
      Mac operating systems.[58] January 2018 WhatsApp launches WhatsApp
      Business, a platform for small enterprises where they can connect with
      customers.[59] April 2018 WhatsApp co-founder and CEO Jan Koum announces
      he’s leaving the company after clashes with Facebook, saying “I sold my
      users’ privacy”.[60] September 2018 WhatsApp launches group audio and
      video calls.[61] vte 2009–2014 WhatsApp was founded in February 2009 by
      Brian Acton and Jan Koum, former employees of Yahoo!. In January 2009,
      after Koum purchased an iPhone, he and Acton decided to create an app for
      the App Store. The idea started off as an app that would display statuses
      in a phone's Contacts menu - showing if a person was at work or on a
      call.[62] Their discussions often took place at the home of Koum's Russian
      friend Alex Fishman in West San Jose. They realized that to take the idea
      further, they would need an iPhone developer. Fishman visited
      RentACoder.com, found Russian developer Igor Solomennikov, and introduced
      him to Koum.[62] Koum named the app WhatsApp to sound like "what's up". On
      February 24, 2009, he incorporated[63] WhatsApp Inc. in California.
      However, when early versions of WhatsApp kept crashing, Koum considered
      giving up and looking for a new job. Acton encouraged him to wait for a
      "few more months".[62] In June 2009, when the app had been downloaded by
      only a handful of Fishman's Russian-speaking friends, Apple launched push
      notifications, allowing users to be pinged even when not using the app.
      Koum updated WhatsApp so that everyone in the user's network would be
      notified when a user's status changed. This new facility, to Koum's
      surprise, was used by users to ping "each other with jokey custom statuses
      like, ‘I woke up late’ or ‘I'm on my way.’"[62] Fishman said "At some
      point it sort of became instant messaging".[62] WhatsApp 2.0 was released
      in August 2009 with a purpose-designed messaging component; the number of
      active users suddenly increased to 250,000. Although Acton was working on
      another startup idea, he decided to join the company.[27] In October 2009,
      Acton persuaded five former friends at Yahoo! to invest $250,000 in seed
      funding, and Acton became a co-founder and was given a stake. He
      officially joined WhatsApp on November 1.[27] After months at beta stage,
      the application launched in November 2009 on the App Store, exclusively
      for the iPhone. Koum then hired a friend in Los Angeles, Chris Peiffer, to
      develop a BlackBerry version, which arrived two months later.[27]
      Subsequently, WhatsApp for Symbian OS was added in May 2010, and for
      Android OS in August 2010.[64] In 2010 Google made multiple acquisition
      offers for WhatsApp, which were all declined.[65] To cover the cost of
      sending verification texts to users, WhatsApp was changed from a free
      service to a paid one. In December 2009, the ability to send photos was
      added to the iOS version. By early 2011, WhatsApp was one of the top 20
      apps in the U.S. Apple App Store.[27] In April 2011, Sequoia Capital
      invested about $8 million for more than 15% of the company, after months
      of negotiation by Sequoia partner Jim Goetz.[66][67][68] By February 2013,
      WhatsApp had about 200 million active users and 50 staff members. Sequoia
      invested another $50 million, and WhatsApp was valued at $1.5 billion.[27]
      Some time in 2013[69] WhatsApp acquired Santa Clara-based startup
      SkyMobius, the developers of Vtok,[70] a video and voice calling app.[71]
      In a December 2013 blog post, WhatsApp claimed that 400 million active
      users used the service each month.[72] The year 2013 ended with $148
      million in expenses, of which $138 million in losses.[73]
