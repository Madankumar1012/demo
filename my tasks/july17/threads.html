        Definition: A thread is a single sequential flow of control within a
        program. The real excitement surrounding threads is not about a single
        sequential thread. Rather, it's about the use of multiple threads
        running at the same time and performing different tasks in a single
        program.

        As a sequential flow of control, a thread must carve out some of its own
        resources within a running program. For example, a thread must have its
        own execution stack and program counter. The code running within the
        thread works only within that context. Some other texts use execution
        context as a synonym for thread.
