        YouTube is an American online video sharing and social media platform
        headquartered in San Bruno, California, United States. Accessible
        worldwide,[6] it was launched on February 14, 2005, by Steve Chen, Chad
        Hurley, and Jawed Karim. It is owned by Google and is the second most
        visited website, after Google Search. YouTube has more than 2.5 billion
        monthly users,[7] who collectively watch more than one billion hours of
        videos each day.[8] As of May 2019, videos were being uploaded at a rate
        of more than 500 hours of content per minute.[9][10] In October 2006,
        YouTube was bought by Google for $1.65 billion.[11] Google's ownership
        of YouTube expanded the site's business model, expanding from generating
        revenue from advertisements alone to offering paid content such as
        movies and exclusive content produced by YouTube. It also offers YouTube
        Premium, a paid subscription option for watching content without ads.
        YouTube also approved creators to participate in Google's AdSense
        program, which seeks to generate more revenue for both parties. YouTube
        reported revenue of $29.2 billion in 2022.[citation needed] In 2021,
        YouTube's annual advertising revenue increased to $28.8 billion, an
        increase in revenue of 9 billion from the previous year.[1] Since its
        purchase by Google, YouTube has expanded beyond the core website into
        mobile apps, network television, and the ability to link with other
        platforms. Video categories on YouTube include music videos, video
        clips, news, short films, feature films, songs, documentaries, movie
        trailers, teasers, live streams, vlogs, and more. Most content is
        generated by individuals, including collaborations between YouTubers and
        corporate sponsors. Established media corporations such as Disney,
        Paramount, NBCUniversal, and Warner Bros. Discovery have also created
        and expanded their corporate YouTube channels to advertise to a greater
        audience. YouTube has had unprecedented social impact, influencing
        popular culture, internet trends, and creating multimillionaire
        celebrities. Despite its growth and success, it has been widely
        criticized for allegedly facilitating the spread of misinformation and
        the sharing of copyrighted content, routinely violating its users'
        privacy, enabling censorship, and endangering child safety and
        wellbeing, and for its guidelines and how they are implemented. History
        Main article: History of YouTube Founding and initial growth (2005–2006)
        From left to right: Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim, the
        founders of YouTube YouTube was founded by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and
        Jawed Karim. The trio were early employees of PayPal, which left them
        enriched after the company was bought by eBay.[12] Hurley had studied
        design at the Indiana University of Pennsylvania, and Chen and Karim
        studied computer science together at the University of Illinois
        Urbana-Champaign.[13] According to a story that has often been repeated
        in the media, Hurley and Chen developed the idea for YouTube during the
        early months of 2005, after they had experienced difficulty sharing
        videos that had been shot at a dinner party at Chen's apartment in San
        Francisco. Karim did not attend the party and denied that it had
        occurred, but Chen remarked that the idea that YouTube was founded after
        a dinner party "was probably very strengthened by marketing ideas around
        creating a story that was very digestible".[14] Karim said the
        inspiration for YouTube first came from the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime
        show controversy, when Janet Jackson's breast was briefly exposed by
        Justin Timberlake during the halftime show. Karim could not easily find
        video clips of the incident and the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami online,
        which led to the idea of a video-sharing site.[15] Hurley and Chen said
        that the original idea for YouTube was a video version of an online
        dating service and had been influenced by the website Hot or
        Not.[14][16] They created posts on Craigslist asking attractive women to
        upload videos of themselves to YouTube in exchange for a $100
        reward.[17] Difficulty in finding enough dating videos led to a change
        of plans, with the site's founders deciding to accept uploads of any
        video.[18] The YouTube logo used from its launch until 2007; it returned
        in 2008 before being removed again in 2010. Another version of this logo
        without the "Broadcast Yourself" slogan was used until 2011. YouTube
        began as a venture capital–funded technology startup. Between November
        2005 and April 2006, the company raised money from various investors,
        with Sequoia Capital and Artis Capital Management being the largest
        two.[12][19] YouTube's early headquarters were situated above a pizzeria
        and a Japanese restaurant in San Mateo, California.[20] In February
        2005, the company activated www.youtube.com.[21] The first video was
        uploaded on April 23, 2005. Titled "Me at the zoo", it shows co-founder
        Jawed Karim at the San Diego Zoo and can still be viewed on the
        site.[22][23] In May, the company launched a public beta and by
        November, a Nike ad featuring Ronaldinho became the first video to reach
        one million total views.[24][25] The site launched officially on
        December 15, 2005, by which time the site was receiving 8 million views
        a day.[26][27] Clips at the time were limited to 100 megabytes, as
        little as 30 seconds of footage.[28] YouTube was not the first
        video-sharing site on the Internet; Vimeo was launched in November 2004,
        though that site remained a side project of its developers from
        CollegeHumor at the time and did not grow much, either.[29] The week of
        YouTube's launch, NBC-Universal's Saturday Night Live ran a skit "Lazy
        Sunday" by The Lonely Island. Besides helping to bolster ratings and
        long-term viewership for Saturday Night Live, "Lazy Sunday"'s status as
        an early viral video helped establish YouTube as an important
        website.[30] Unofficial uploads of the skit to YouTube drew in more than
        five million collective views by February 2006 before they were removed
        when NBCUniversal requested it two months later based on copyright
        concerns.[31] Despite eventually being taken down, these duplicate
        uploads of the skit helped popularize YouTube's reach and led to the
        upload of more third-party content.[32][33] The site grew rapidly; in
        July 2006, the company announced that more than 65,000 new videos were
        being uploaded every day and that the site was receiving 100 million
        video views per day.[34] The choice of the name www.youtube.com led to
        problems for a similarly named website, www.utube.com. That site's
        owner, Universal Tube  Rollform Equipment, filed a lawsuit against
        YouTube in November 2006 after being regularly overloaded by people
        looking for YouTube. Universal Tube subsequently changed its website to
        www.utubeonline.com.[35][36] Broadcast Yourself era (2006–2013)
        YouTube's headquarters in San Bruno, California On October 9, 2006,
        Google announced that it had acquired YouTube for $1.65 billion in
        Google stock.[37][38] The deal was finalized on November 13,
        2006.[39][40] Google's acquisition launched newfound interest in
        video-sharing sites; IAC, which now owned Vimeo, focused on supporting
        the content creators to distinguish itself from YouTube.[29] It is at
        this time YouTube issued the slogan "Broadcast Yourself". The company
        experienced rapid growth. The Daily Telegraph wrote that in 2007,
        YouTube consumed as much bandwidth as the entire Internet in 2000.[41]
        By 2010, the company had reached a market share of around 43% and more
        than 14 billion views of videos, according to comScore.[42] That year,
        the company simplified its interface to increase the time users would
        spend on the site.[43] In 2011, more than three billion videos were
        being watched each day with 48 hours of new videos uploaded every
        minute.[44][45][46] However, most of these views came from a relatively
        small number of videos; according to a software engineer at that time,
        30% of videos accounted for 99% of views on the site.[47] That year, the
        company again changed its interface and at the same time, introduced a
        new logo with a darker shade of red.[48][49] A subsequent interface
        change, designed to unify the experience across desktop, TV, and mobile,
        was rolled out in 2013.[50] By that point, more than 100 hours were
        being uploaded every minute, increasing to 300 hours by November
        2014.[51][52] YouTube logo from 2015 until 2017 During this time, the
        company also went through some organizational changes. In October 2006,
        YouTube moved to a new office in San Bruno, California.[53] Hurley
        announced that he would be stepping down as a chief executive officer of
        YouTube to take an advisory role and that Salar Kamangar would take over
        as head of the company in October 2010.[54] In December 2009, YouTube
        partnered with Vevo.[55] In April 2010, Lady Gaga's "Bad Romance" became
        the most viewed video, becoming the first video to reach 200 million
        views on May 9, 2010.[56] Susan Wojcicki and going mainstream
        (2014–2018) YouTube logo since 2017 Susan Wojcicki was appointed CEO of
        YouTube in February 2014.[57] In January 2016, YouTube expanded its
        headquarters in San Bruno by purchasing an office park for $215 million.
        The complex has 51,468 square metres (554,000 square feet) of space and
        can house up to 2,800 employees.[58] YouTube officially launched the
        "polymer" redesign of its user interfaces based on Material Design
        language as its default, as well a redesigned logo that is built around
        the service's play button emblem in August 2017.[59] Through this
        period, YouTube tried several new ways to generate revenue beyond
        advertisements. In 2013, YouTube launched a pilot program for content
        providers to offer premium, subscription-based channels.[60][61] This
        effort was discontinued in January 2018 and relaunched in June, with
        US$4.99 channel subscriptions.[62][63] These channel subscriptions
        complemented the existing Super Chat ability, launched in 2017, which
        allows viewers to donate between $1 and $500 to have their comment
        highlighted.[64] In 2014, YouTube announced a subscription service known
        as "Music Key," which bundled ad-free streaming of music content on
        YouTube with the existing Google Play Music service.[65] The service
        continued to evolve in 2015 when YouTube announced YouTube Red, a new
        premium service that would offer ad-free access to all content on the
        platform (succeeding the Music Key service released the previous year),
        premium original series, and films produced by YouTube personalities, as
        well as background playback of content on mobile devices. YouTube also
        released YouTube Music, a third app oriented towards streaming and
        discovering the music content hosted on the YouTube
        platform.[66][67][68] The company also attempted to create products
        appealing to specific viewers. YouTube released a mobile app known as
        YouTube Kids in 2015, designed to provide an experience optimized for
        children. It features a simplified user interface, curated selections of
        channels featuring age-appropriate content, and parental control
        features.[69] Also in 2015, YouTube launched YouTube Gaming—a video
        gaming-oriented vertical and app for videos and live streaming, intended
        to compete with the Amazon.com-owned Twitch.[70] The company was
        attacked on April 3, 2018, when a shooting occurred at YouTube's
        headquarters in San Bruno, California, which wounded four and resulted
        in the death of the shooter.[71]
