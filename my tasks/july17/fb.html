        Facebook is a social networking website that was founded in February
        2004 by Harvard University students Chris Hughes, Andrew McCollum,
        Dustin Moskovitz, Eduardo Saverin and Mark Zuckerberg. The idea behind
        Facebook was to provide an online book of faces for university students
        to connect and share information.

        Facebook is an online social media and social networking service owned
        by American technology giant Meta Platforms. Created in 2004 by Mark
        Zuckerberg with fellow Harvard College students and roommates Eduardo
        Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, its name
        derives from the face book directories often given to American
        university students. Membership was initially limited to only Harvard
        students, gradually expanding to other North American universities and,
        since 2006, anyone over 13 years old. As of December 2022, Facebook
        claimed 2.96 billion monthly active users,[6] and ranked third worldwide
        among the most visited websites.[7] It was the most downloaded mobile
        app of the 2010s.[8] Facebook can be accessed from devices with Internet
        connectivity, such as personal computers, tablets and smartphones. After
        registering, users can create a profile revealing information about
        themselves. They can post text, photos and multimedia which are shared
        with any other users who have agreed to be their "friend" or, with
        different privacy settings, publicly. Users can also communicate
        directly with each other with Messenger, join common-interest groups,
        and receive notifications on the activities of their Facebook friends
        and the pages they follow. The subject of numerous controversies,
        Facebook has often been criticized over issues such as user privacy (as
        with the Cambridge Analytica data scandal), political manipulation (as
        with the 2016 U.S. elections) and mass surveillance.[9] Facebook has
        also been subject to criticism over psychological effects such as
        addiction and low self-esteem, and various controversies over content
        such as fake news, conspiracy theories, copyright infringement, and hate
        speech.[10] Commentators have accused Facebook of willingly facilitating
        the spread of such content, as well as exaggerating its number of users
        to appeal to advertisers.[11] History Further information: History of
        Facebook 2003–2006: Thefacebook, Thiel investment, and name change
        Original layout and name of Thefacebook in 2004, showing Al Pacino's
        face superimposed with binary numbers as Facebook's original logo,
        designed by co-founder Andrew McCollum[12] Zuckerberg built a website
        called "Facemash" in 2003 while attending Harvard University. The site
        was comparable to Hot or Not and used "photos compiled from the online
        face books of nine Houses, placing two next to each other at a time and
        asking users to choose the "hotter" person".[13] Facemash attracted 450
        visitors and 22,000 photo-views in its first four hours.[14] The site
        was sent to several campus group listservs, but was shut down a few days
        later by Harvard administration. Zuckerberg faced expulsion and was
        charged with breaching security, violating copyrights and violating
        individual privacy. Ultimately, the charges were dropped.[13] Zuckerberg
        expanded on this project that semester by creating a social study tool.
        He uploaded art images, each accompanied by a comments section, to a
        website he shared with his classmates.[15] A "face book" is a student
        directory featuring photos and personal information.[14] In 2003,
        Harvard had only a paper version[16] along with private online
        directories.[13][17] Zuckerberg told The Harvard Crimson, "Everyone's
        been talking a lot about a universal face book within Harvard. ... I
        think it's kind of silly that it would take the University a couple of
        years to get around to it. I can do it better than they can, and I can
        do it in a week."[17] In January 2004, Zuckerberg coded a new website,
        known as "TheFacebook", inspired by a Crimson editorial about Facemash,
        stating, "It is clear that the technology needed to create a centralized
        Website is readily available ... the benefits are many." Zuckerberg met
        with Harvard student Eduardo Saverin, and each of them agreed to invest
        $1,000 ($1,549 in 2022 dollars[18]) in the site.[19] On February 4,
        2004, Zuckerberg launched "TheFacebook", originally located at
        thefacebook.com.[20] Mark Zuckerberg, co-creator of Facebook, in his
        Harvard dorm room, 2005 Six days after the site launched, Harvard
        seniors Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra accused
        Zuckerberg of intentionally misleading them into believing that he would
        help them build a social network called HarvardConnection.com. They
        claimed that he was instead using their ideas to build a competing
        product.[21] The three complained to the Crimson and the newspaper began
        an investigation. They later sued Zuckerberg, settling in 2008[22] for
        1.2 million shares (worth $300 million ($382 million in 2022
        dollars[18]) at Facebook's IPO).[23] Membership was initially restricted
        to students of Harvard College. Within a month, more than half the
        undergraduates had registered.[24] Dustin Moskovitz, Andrew McCollum,
        and Chris Hughes joined Zuckerberg to help manage the growth of the
        website.[25] In March 2004, Facebook expanded to Columbia, Stanford and
        Yale.[26] It then became available to all Ivy League colleges, Boston
        University, NYU, MIT, and successively most universities in the United
        States and Canada.[27][28] In mid-2004, Napster co-founder and
        entrepreneur Sean Parker—an informal advisor to Zuckerberg—became
        company president.[29] In June 2004, the company moved to Palo Alto,
        California.[30] Sean Parker called Reid Hoffman to fund Facebook.
        However, Reid Hoffman was too busy launching LinkedIn so he set Facebook
        up with PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, who gave Facebook its first
        investment later that month.[31][32] In 2005, the company dropped "the"
        from its name after purchasing the domain name Facebook.com for
        US$200,000 ($299,676 in 2022 dollars[18]).[33] The domain had belonged
        to AboutFace Corporation. In May 2005, Accel Partners invested $12.7
        million ($19 million in 2022 dollars[18]) in Facebook, and Jim
        Breyer[34] added $1 million ($1.5 million in 2022 dollars[18]) of his
        own money. A high-school version of the site launched in September
        2005.[35] Eligibility expanded to include employees of several
        companies, including Apple Inc. and Microsoft.[36] 2006–2012: Public
        access, Microsoft alliance, and rapid growth In May 2006, Facebook hired
        its first intern, Julie Zhuo.[37] After a month, Zhuo was hired as a
        full-time engineer.[37] On September 26, 2006, Facebook opened to
        everyone at least 13 years old with a valid email address.[38][39][40]
        By late 2007, Facebook had 100,000 pages on which companies promoted
        themselves.[41] Organization pages began rolling out in May 2009.[42] On
        October 24, 2007, Microsoft announced that it had purchased a 1.6% share
        of Facebook for $240 million ($339 million in 2022 dollars[18]), giving
        Facebook a total implied value of around $15 billion ($21.2 billion in
        2022 dollars[18]). Microsoft's purchase included rights to place
        international advertisements.[43][44] In May 2007, at the first f8
        developers conference, Facebook announced the launch of the Facebook
        Developer Platform, providing a framework for software developers to
        create applications that interact with core Facebook features. By the
        second annual f8 developers conference on July 23, 2008, the number of
        applications on the platform had grown to 33,000, and the number of
        registered developers had exceeded 400,000.[45] The website won awards
        such as placement into the "Top 100 Classic Websites" by PC Magazine in
        2007,[46] and winning the "People's Voice Award" from the Webby Awards
        in 2008.[47] In early 2008, Facebook became EBITDA profitable, but was
        not cash flow positive yet.[48] On July 20, 2008, Facebook introduced
        "Facebook Beta", a significant redesign of its user interface on
        selected networks. The Mini-Feed and Wall were consolidated, profiles
        were separated into tabbed sections, and an effort was made to create a
        cleaner look.[49] Facebook began migrating users to the new version in
        September 2008.[50] In July 2008, Facebook sued StudiVZ, a German social
        network that was alleged to be visually and functionally similar to
        Facebook.[51][52] In October 2008, Facebook announced that its
        international headquarters would locate in Dublin, Ireland.[53] A
        January 2009 Compete.com study ranked Facebook the most used social
        networking service by worldwide monthly active users.[54][better source
        needed] China blocked Facebook in 2009 following the Ürümqi riots.[55]
        In 2009, Yuri Milner's DST (which later split into DST Global and
        Mail.ru Group), alongside Uzbek Russian metals magnate Alisher Usmanov,
        invested $200 million in Facebook when it was valued at $10
        billion.[56][57][58] A separate stake was also acquired by Usmanov's USM
        Holdings on another occasion.[59][56] According to the New York Times in
        2013, "Mr. Usmanov and other Russian investors at one point owned nearly
        10 percent of Facebook, though precise details of their ownership stakes
        are difficult to assess."[59] It was later revealed in 2017 by the
        Paradise Papers that lending by Russian state-backed VTB Bank and
        Gazprom's investment vehicle partially financed these 2009 investments,
        although Milner was reportedly unaware at the time.[60][61] In May 2009,
        Zuckerberg said of the $200 million Russian investment, "This investment
        is purely buffer for us. It is not something we needed to get to cash
        flow positive."[62] In September 2009, Facebook became cash flow
        positive ahead of schedule[63][64] after closing a roughly $200 million
        gap in operating profitability.[64] In 2010, Facebook won the Crunchie
        "Best Overall Startup Or Product" award[65] for the third year in a
        row.[66] The company announced 500 million users in July 2010.[67] Half
        of the site's membership used Facebook daily, for an average of 34
        minutes, while 150 million users accessed the site from mobile devices.
        A company representative called the milestone a "quiet revolution".[68]
        In October 2010 groups were introduced.[69] In November 2010, based on
        SecondMarket Inc. (an exchange for privately held companies' shares),
        Facebook's value was $41 billion ($55 billion in 2022 dollars[18]). The
        company had slightly surpassed eBay to become the third largest American
        web company after Google and Amazon.com.[70][71] On November 15, 2010,
        Facebook announced it had acquired the domain name fb.com from the
        American Farm Bureau Federation for an undisclosed amount. On January
        11, 2011, the Farm Bureau disclosed $8.5 million ($11.1 million in 2022
        dollars[18]) in "domain sales income", making the acquisition of FB.com
        one of the ten highest domain sales in history.[72]
