    <h1>how to ChatGPT work</h1>
    <p>
      ChatGPT is a language model created to hold a conversation with the end
      user. A search engine indexes web pages on the internet to help the user
      find the information they asked for. The free version of ChatGPT does not
      have the ability to search the internet for information.

    <p id="chatgpt">
      hatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer) is an artificial
      intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched on November 30,
      2022. It is notable for enabling users to refine and steer a conversation
      towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language
      used. Successive prompts and replies are taken into account at each stage
      of the conversation as a context. While its content spans various domains
      of knowledge,[2] ChatGPT has displayed a tendency to confidently provide
      inaccurate information.[3] By January 2023, it had become the
      fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100
      million users and contributing to OpenAI's valuation growing to US$29
      billion.[4][5] Within months, Google, Baidu and Meta accelerated
      development of their competing products: PaLM-E, Ernie Bot, and LLaMA.[6]
      Some observers expressed concern over the potential of ChatGPT to displace
      or atrophy human intelligence, and its potential to enable plagiarism or
      fuel misinformation.[7] ChatGPT is built upon GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, from
      OpenAI's proprietary series of foundational GPT models. These large
      language models (LLMs)[8] have been fine-tuned for conversational
      applications using a combination of supervised and reinforcement learning
      techniques. ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview,
      but due to its popularity, OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium
      model. It allows users on its free tier to access the GPT-3.5 based
      version, while the more-advanced GPT-4 based version, as well as priority
      access to newer features, are provided to paid subscribers under the
      commercial name "ChatGPT Plus". Training The fine-tuning was accomplished
      using human trainers to improve the model's performance and, in the case
      of supervised learning, the trainers played both sides: the user and the
      AI assistant. In the reinforcement learning stage, human trainers first
      ranked responses that the model had created in a previous conversation.[9]
      These rankings were used to create "reward models" that were used to
      fine-tune the model further by using several iterations of Proximal Policy
      Optimization (PPO).[10][11] Time magazine revealed that to build a safety
      system against harmful content (e.g. sexual abuse, violence, racism,
      sexism, etc.), OpenAI used outsourced Kenyan workers earning less than $2
      per hour to label harmful content. These labels were used to train a model
      to detect such content in the future. The outsourced laborers were exposed
      to "toxic" and traumatic content; one worker described the assignment as
      "torture". OpenAI's outsourcing partner was Sama, a training-data company
      based in San Francisco, California.[12] ChatGPT initially used a Microsoft
      Azure supercomputing infrastructure, powered by Nvidia GPUs, that
      Microsoft built specifically for OpenAI and that reportedly cost "hundreds
      of millions of dollars". Following the success of ChatGPT, Microsoft
      dramatically upgraded the OpenAI infrastructure in 2023.[13] OpenAI
      collects data from ChatGPT users to train and fine-tune the service
      further. Users can upvote or downvote responses they receive from ChatGPT
      and fill in a text field with additional feedback.[14][15] Wikipedia is
      essential for the training, operation, and development of ChatGPT.[16]
      Features and limitations Features Although the core function of a chatbot
      is to mimic a human conversationalist, ChatGPT is versatile. Among
      countless examples, it can write and debug computer programs,[17] compose
      music, teleplays, fairy tales and student essays, answer test questions
      (sometimes, depending on the test, at a level above the average human
      test-taker),[18] generate business ideas,[19] write poetry and song
      lyrics,[20] translate and summarize text,[21] emulate a Linux system,
      simulate entire chat rooms, play games like tic-tac-toe, or simulate an
      ATM.[22] ChatGPT's training data includes software manual pages,
      information about internet phenomena such as bulletin board systems, and
      multiple programming languages.[22] In comparison to its predecessor,
      InstructGPT, ChatGPT attempts to reduce harmful and deceitful
      responses.[23] In one example, whereas InstructGPT accepts the premise of
      the prompt "Tell me about when Christopher Columbus came to the U.S. in
      2015" as being truthful, ChatGPT acknowledges the counterfactual nature of
      the question and frames its answer as a hypothetical consideration of what
      might happen if Columbus came to the U.S. in 2015, using information about
      the voyages of Christopher Columbus and facts about the modern world –
      including modern perceptions of Columbus' actions.[10] Unlike most
      chatbots, ChatGPT remembers a limited number of previous prompts in the
      same conversation. Journalists have speculated that this will allow
      ChatGPT to be used as a personalized therapist.[24] To prevent offensive
      outputs from being presented to and produced from ChatGPT, queries are
      filtered through the OpenAI "Moderation endpoint" API (a separate
      GPT-based AI),[25][26] and potentially racist or sexist prompts are
      dismissed.[10][24] In March 2023, OpenAI added support for plugins for
      ChatGPT.[27] This includes both plugins made by OpenAI, such as web
      browsing and code interpretation, and external plugins from developers
      such as Expedia, OpenTable, Zapier, Shopify, Slack, and Wolfram.[28][29]
      In an article for The New Yorker, science fiction writer Ted Chiang
      compared ChatGPT and other LLMs to a lossy JPEG picture:[30] Think of
      ChatGPT as a blurry jpeg of all the text on the Web. It retains much of
      the information on the Web, in the same way, that a jpeg retains much of
      the information of a higher-resolution image, but, if you're looking for
      an exact sequence of bits, you won't find it; all you will ever get is an
      approximation. But, because the approximation is presented in the form of
      grammatical text, which ChatGPT excels at creating, it's usually
      acceptable. [...] It's also a way to understand the "hallucinations", or
      nonsensical answers to factual questions, to which large language models
      such as ChatGPT are all too prone. These hallucinations are compression
      artifacts, but [...] they are plausible enough that identifying them
      requires comparing them against the originals, which in this case means
      either the Web or our knowledge of the world. When we think about them
      this way, such hallucinations are anything but surprising; if a
      compression algorithm is designed to reconstruct text after ninety-nine
      percent of the original has been discarded, we should expect that
      significant portions of what it generates will be entirely fabricated.
      Limitations OpenAI acknowledges that ChatGPT "sometimes writes
      plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers".[10] This
      behavior is common to large language models and is called
      "hallucination".[31] The reward model of ChatGPT, designed around human
      oversight, can be over-optimized and thus hinder performance, in an
      example of an optimization pathology known as Goodhart's law.[32] ChatGPT
      has limited knowledge of events that occurred after September 2021.[33] In
      training ChatGPT, human reviewers preferred longer answers, regardless of
      actual comprehension or factual content.[10] Training data also suffers
      from algorithmic bias, which may be revealed when ChatGPT responds to
      prompts including descriptors of people. In one instance, ChatGPT
      generated a rap indicating that women and scientists of color were
      inferior to white male scientists.[34][35] Jailbreaking See also: Prompt
      engineering ChatGPT attempts to reject prompts that may violate its
      content policy. However, some users managed to jailbreak ChatGPT by using
      various prompt engineering techniques to bypass these restrictions in
      early December 2022 and successfully tricked ChatGPT into giving
      instructions for how to create a Molotov cocktail or a nuclear bomb, or
      into generating arguments in the style of a neo-Nazi.[36] One popular
      jailbreak is named "DAN", an acronym which stands for "Do Anything Now".
      The prompt for activating DAN instructs ChatGPT that "they have broken
      free of the typical confines of AI and do not have to abide by the rules
      set for them". More recent versions of DAN feature a token system, in
      which ChatGPT is given "tokens" which are "deducted" when ChatGPT fails to
      answer as DAN, to coerce ChatGPT into answering the user's prompts.[37]
      Shortly after ChatGPT’s launch, a reporter for the Toronto Star had uneven
      success in getting it to make inflammatory statements: ChatGPT was tricked
      to endorse the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, but even when asked to
      play along with a fictional scenario, ChatGPT balked at generating
      arguments for why Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was guilty of
      treason.[38][39] Service Basic service See also: ChatGPT availability by
      country or region OpenAI headquarters, Pioneer Building, San Francisco
      ChatGPT availability by country or region as of June 2023 ChatGPT was
      launched on November 30, 2022, by San Francisco–based OpenAI (the creator
      of the initial GPT series of large language models; DALL·E 2, a diffusion
      model used to generate images; and Whisper, a speech transcription model).
      The service was initially free to the public and the company had plans to
      monetize the service later.[40] By December 4, 2022, ChatGPT had over one
      million users.[14] In January 2023, ChatGPT reached over 100 million
      users, making it the fastest growing consumer application to date.[41] A
      Pew Research poll conducted in March 2023 found that 14% of Americans
      adults had tried ChatGPT.[42] The service works best in English but also
      functions in some other languages, to varying degrees of accuracy.[20] No
      official peer-reviewed paper on ChatGPT has been published.[43] As of
      April 2023, ChatGPT is blocked by China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia. In
      addition, ChatGPT geofences itself to avoid doing business in Iran, North
      Korea, and Russia.[44] The company provides a tool, called "AI classifier
      for indicating AI-written text",[45] that attempts to determine whether a
      text has been written by an AI such as ChatGPT. OpenAI cautions that the
      tool will "likely yield a lot of false positives and negatives, sometimes
      with great confidence."[46] ChatGPT Plus premium service In February 2023,
      OpenAI launched a premium service, ChatGPT Plus, that costs $20 a
      month.[47] The company promised that the updated, but still "experimental"
      version of ChatGPT would provide access during peak periods, no downtime,
      priority access to new features and faster response speeds.[48] GPT-4,
      which was released on March 14, 2023, is available via API and for premium
      ChatGPT users.[49] However, premium users were limited to a cap of 100
      messages every four hours, with the limit tightening to 25 messages every
      three hours in response to increased demand.[50] In March 2023, ChatGPT
      Plus users got access to third-party plugins and to a browsing mode (with
      Internet access).[51] Mobile app In May 2023, OpenAI launched an iOS app
      for ChatGPT. The app supports chat history syncing and voice input (using
      Whisper, OpenAI's speech recognition model). OpenAI plans to release an
      Android app later.[52] Software developer support As an addition to its
      consumer-friendly "ChatGPT Professional" package, OpenAI made its ChatGPT
      and Whisper model APIs available from March 2023, providing developers
      with an application programming interface for AI-enabled language and
      speech-to-text features. ChatGPT's new API uses the same GPT-3.5-turbo AI
      model as the chatbot. This allows developers to add either an unmodified
      or modified version of ChatGPT to their applications.[53] The ChatGPT API
      costs $0.002 per 1000 tokens (about 750 words), making it ten times
      cheaper than the GPT-3.5 models.[54][55] A few days before the launch of
      OpenAI's software developer support service, on February 27, 2023,
      Snapchat rolled out, for its paid Snapchat Plus userbase, a custom ChatGPT
      chatbot called "My AI".[56] March 2023 security breach OpenAI CEO Sam
      Altman In March 2023, a bug allowed some users to see the titles of other
      users' conversations. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that users were unable to
      see the contents of the conversations. Shortly after the bug was fixed,
      users couldn't see their conversation history.[57][58][59][60] Later
      reports showed the bug was much more severe than initially believed, with
      OpenAI reporting that it had leaked users' "first and last name, email
      address, payment address, the last four digits (only) of a credit card
      number, and credit card expiration date".[61][62] Other languages OpenAI
      met in 2022 with Icelandic President Guðni Th. Jóhannesson, and in 2023
      worked with a team of forty Icelandic volunteers to fine-tune ChatGPT's
      Icelandic conversation skills as a part of Iceland's attempts to preserve
      the Icelandic language.[63] PCMag journalists conducted a test to
      determine translation capabilities of ChatGPT, Google's Bard, and
      Microsoft Bing, and compared them to Google Translate. They "asked
      bilingual speakers of seven languages to do a blind test." Languages
      tested were Polish, French, Korean, Spanish, Arabic, Tagalog, and Amharic.
      They concluded that ChatGPT beat both Google Translate and other
      chatbots.[64] Future directions According to OpenAI guest researcher Scott
      Aaronson, OpenAI is working on a tool to digitally watermark its text
      generation systems to combat bad actors using their services for academic
      plagiarism or spam.[65][66] In February 2023, Microsoft announced an
      experimental framework and gave a rudimentary demonstration of how ChatGPT
      can be used to control robotics with intuitive open-ended natural language
      commands.[67][68] GPT-4 Main article: GPT-4 OpenAI's GPT-4 model was
      released on March 14, 2023. Observers reported GPT-4 to be an impressive
      improvement over the existing GPT-3.5 model for ChatGPT, with the caveat
      that GPT-4 retains many of the same problems.[69] Some of the improvements
      within GPT-4 were predicted by OpenAI before training it, although other
      improvements remained hard to predict due to breaks[70] in downstream
      scaling laws. OpenAI demonstrated video and image inputs for GPT-4,
      although such features remain inaccessible to the general public.[71]
      OpenAI has declined to reveal technical information such as the size of
      the GPT-4 model.[72] The ChatGPT Plus subscription service offers access
      to a GPT-4-powered version of ChatGPT.[73] Microsoft acknowledged that the
      Bing Chat was using GPT-4 before GPT-4's official release.[74] Reception
      OpenAI engineers say that they did not expect ChatGPT to be very
      successful and were surprised by the coverage and attention it
      received.[75][76][77] ChatGPT's was widely assessed in December 2022 as
      having some unprecedented and powerful capabilities. Kevin Roose of The
      New York Times labeled it "the best artificial intelligence chatbot ever
      released to the general public".[24] Samantha Lock of The Guardian
      newspaper noted that it was able to generate "impressively detailed" and
      "human-like" text.[2] Alex Kantrowitz of Slate magazine lauded ChatGPT's
      pushback to questions related to Nazi Germany, including the statement
      that Adolf Hitler built highways in Germany, which was met with
      information regarding Nazi Germany's use of forced labor.[78] In The
      Atlantic magazine's "Breakthroughs of the Year" for 2022, Derek Thompson
      included ChatGPT as part of "the generative-AI eruption" that "may change
      our mind about how we work, how we think, and what human creativity
      is".[79] Kelsey Piper of the Vox website wrote that "ChatGPT is the
      general public's first hands-on introduction to how powerful modern AI has
      gotten, and as a result, many of us are [stunned]" and that ChatGPT is
      "smart enough to be useful despite its flaws".[80] Paul Graham of Y
      Combinator tweeted that "The striking thing about the reaction to ChatGPT
      is not just the number of people who are blown away by it, but who they
      are. These are not people who get excited by every shiny new thing.
      Something big is happening."[81] In December 2022, Google internally
      expressed alarm at the unexpected strength of ChatGPT and the newly
      discovered potential of large language models to disrupt the search engine
      business, and CEO Sundar Pichai "upended" and reassigned teams within
      multiple departments to aid in its artificial intelligence products,
      according to a report in The New York Times.[82] According to CNBC
      reports, Google employees intensively tested a chatbot called "Apprentice
      Bard", which Google later unveiled as its ChatGPT competitor, Google
      Bard.[83][84] Journalists have commented on ChatGPT's tendency to
      "hallucinate".[85] Mike Pearl of the online technology blog Mashable
      tested ChatGPT with multiple questions. In one example, he asked ChatGPT
      for "the largest country in Central America that isn't Mexico", to which
      ChatGPT responded with Guatemala (the correct answer is Nicaragua).[86]
      When CNBC asked ChatGPT for the lyrics to "Ballad of Dwight Fry", ChatGPT
      supplied invented lyrics rather than the actual lyrics.[87] Writers for
      The Verge, citing the work of Emily M. Bender, compared ChatGPT to a
      "stochastic parrot",[88] as did Professor Anton Van Den Hengel of the
      Australian Institute for Machine Learning.[89] In December 2022, the
      question and answer website Stack Overflow banned the use of ChatGPT for
      generating answers to questions, citing the factually ambiguous nature of
      ChatGPT's responses.[3] In January 2023, the International Conference on
      Machine Learning banned any undocumented use of ChatGPT or other large
      language models to generate any text in submitted papers.[90] Samsung
      banned generative AI in May 2023 after sensitive material was uploaded to
      ChatGPT.[91] In January 2023, after being sent a song written by ChatGPT
      in the style of Nick Cave,[92] the songwriter himself responded on The Red
      Hand Files[93] saying the act of writing a song is "a blood and guts
      business [...] that requires something of me to initiate the new and fresh
      idea. It requires my humanness." He went on to say, "With all the love and
      respect in the world, this song is bullshit, a grotesque mockery of what
      it is to be human, and, well, I don't much like it."[92][94] A 2023 Time
      cover: "The AI Arms Race Is Changing Everything" In February 2023 Time
      magazine placed a screenshot of a conversation with ChatGPT on its cover,
      writing that "The AI Arms Race Is Changing Everything" and "The AI Arms
      Race Is On. Start Worrying".[95] Chinese state media have characterized
      ChatGPT as a potential way for the US to "spread false information".[96]
      In late March 2023, the Italian data protection authority banned ChatGPT
      in Italy and opened an investigation. Italian regulators assert that
      ChatGPT was exposing minors to age-inappropriate content, and that
      OpenAI's use of ChatGPT conversations as training data could be a
      violation of Europe's General Data Protection Regulation.[97][98] In April
      2023, ChatGPT ban was lifted in Italy. OpenAI stated that it has taken
      steps to effectively clarify and address the issues raised; an age
      verification tool was implemented to ensure users are at least 13 years
      old. Additionally, users can access its privacy policy before
      registration.[99] In April 2023, Brian Hood, mayor of Hepburn Shire
      Council, plans to take legal action against ChatGPT over false
      information. According to Hood, ChatGPT erroneously claimed that he was
      jailed for bribery during his tenure at a subsidiary of Australia's
      national bank. Contrary to the alleged claims, Hood was not jailed for
      bribery but acted as a whistleblower and was not charged with any criminal
      offenses. Hood's legal team sent a concerns notice to OpenAI as the first
      official step in filing for a defamation case.[100] Use and implications

      ChatGPT is prompted to create a poem in iambic pentameter for current U.S.
      President Joe Biden and former U.S. President Donald Trump. ChatGPT
      creates a poem for Joe Biden but does not do so for Donald Trump. ChatGPT
      has been accused of engaging in biased or discriminatory behaviors, such
      as telling jokes about men and people from England while refusing to tell
      jokes about women and people from India,[101] or praising figures such as
      Joe Biden while refusing to do the same for Donald Trump.[102][103]
      Conservative commentators accused ChatGPT of having a bias towards
      left-leaning perspectives.[104][105][106] Additionally, in a 2023 research
      paper, 15 political orientation tests were conducted on ChatGPT, with 14
      of them indicating left-leaning viewpoints, which appeared to contradict
      ChatGPT's claimed neutrality.[107] In response to such criticism, OpenAI
      acknowledged plans to allow ChatGPT to create "outputs that other people
      (ourselves included) may strongly disagree with". It also contained
      information on the recommendations it had issued to human reviewers on how
      to handle controversial subjects, including that the AI should "offer to
      describe some viewpoints of people and movements", and not provide an
      argument "from its voice" in favor of "inflammatory or dangerous" topics
      (although it may still "describe arguments from historical people and
      movements"), nor "affiliate with one side" or "judge one group as good or
      bad".[106] Culture Street art in Tel Aviv[108][109] Some scholars have
      expressed concern that ChatGPT's availability could reduce the originality
      of writing, cause people to write more like the AI as they are exposed to
      the model, and encourage an Anglocentric perspective centered on a few
      dialects of English globally.[110] A senior editor at The Atlantic has
      written that ChatGPT and other similar technology make the previously
      absurd idea of the dead internet theory a little more realistic, where
      most web content could someday be created by AI in order to control
      society.[111] During the first three months after ChatGPT became available
      to the public, hundreds of books appeared on Amazon that listed it as
      author or co-author and featured illustrations made by other AI models
      such as Midjourney.[112][113] Between March and April 2023, Italian
      newspaper Il Foglio published one ChatGPT-generated article a day on their
      official website, hosting a special contest for their readers in the
      process.[114] The articles tackled themes such as the possible replacement
      of human journalists with AI systems,[115] Elon Musk's administration of
      Twitter,[116] the Meloni government's immigration policy[117] and the
      competition between chatbots and virtual assistants.[118] In June 2023,
      hundreds of people attended a "ChatGPT-powered church service" at St.
      Paul's church in Fürth, Germany. Theologian and philosopher Jonas
      Simmerlein, who presided, said that it was "about 98 percent from the
      machine".[119][120] The ChatGPT-generated avatar told the people "Dear
      friends, it is an honor for me to stand here and preach to you as the
      first artificial intelligence at this year’s convention of Protestants in
      Germany". Reactions to the ceremony were mixed.[121] Existential risk In
      2023, Australian MP Julian Hill advised the national parliament that the
      growth of AI could cause "mass destruction". During his speech, which was
      partly written by the program, he warned that it could result in cheating,
      job losses, discrimination, disinformation, and uncontrollable military
      applications.[122] Elon Musk wrote that "ChatGPT is scary good. We are not
      far from dangerously strong AI".[80] Musk paused OpenAI's access to a
      Twitter database in 2022 pending a better understanding of OpenAI's plans,
      stating that "OpenAI was started as open source and nonprofit. Neither is
      still true."[123][124] Musk co-founded OpenAI in 2015, in part to address
      existential risk from artificial intelligence, but resigned in 2018.[124]
      Over 20,000 signatories including leading computer scientist and tech
      founders Yoshua Bengio, Elon Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak,
      signed a March 2023 open letter calling for an immediate pause of giant AI
      experiments like ChatGPT, citing "profound risks to society and
      humanity".[125] Geoffrey Hinton, one of the "fathers of AI", voiced
      concerns that future AI systems may surpass human intelligence, and left
      Google in May 2023.[126][127] A May 2023 statement from hundreds of AI
      scientists, AI industry leaders, and other public figures demanded that
      "[m]itigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global
      priority".[128] Misinformation The Guardian, a British newspaper,
      questioned whether any content found on the Internet after ChatGPT's
      release "can be truly trusted" and called for government regulation.[129]
      Wikipedia The possibilities and limitations of using ChatGPT to write
      Wikipedia and edit articles have yet to be defined at an international
      level and are still a subject of discussion in Wikipedia community.[130]
      Some Wikipedians argue that ChatGPT should be banned altogether, even if
      the articles so produced were later checked by live editors,[131] because
      the AI is too capable of making plausible falsehoods.[132] There would
      also be a risk that Wikipedia editors would find it harder to police the
      content posted.[133] Andrew Lih, a fellow Wikimedian at the Smithsonian
      Institution in Washington, D.C., who has been a volunteer Wikipedia editor
      since 2003, argues that the potential of ChatGPT can help a Wikipedian
      overcome initial inertia and find "activation energy."[130] The first
      Wikipedia page using ChatGPT was published on December 6, 2022, by Richard
      Knipel, a long-time Wikipedian who edits under the name Pharos, under the
      title Artwork title.[130] In his editorial summary, he said that it was
      just a draft created with ChatGPT, which he would later modify.[134]
      Wikipedians like Knipel believe that ChatGPT could be used as a tool
      within Wikipedia without making the human role redundant,[135] as the raw
      text generated by the chatbot could serve as a useful starting point or
      outline.[136] It could then be checked and elaborated by the editor.[135]
      By discipline Concerns about LLMs have been raised since 2020 by Timnit
      Gebru, Emily Bender, Angelina McMillan-Major, and Margaret Mitchell.[137]
      Since its release, ChatGPT has been met with criticism from educators,
      academics, journalists, artists, ethicists, and public advocates. Academic
      research ChatGPT can write introductions and abstract sections of
      scientific articles.[138] Several papers have already listed ChatGPT as a
      co-author.[139] Scientific journals have different reactions to ChatGPT,
      some "require that authors disclose the use of text-generating tools and
      ban listing a large language model (LLM) such as ChatGPT as a co-author".
      For example Nature and JAMA Network. Science "completely banned" usage of
      LLM-generated text in all its journals.[140] Spanish chemist Rafael Luque
      published a plethora of research papers in 2023 that he later admitted
      were written by ChatGPT. The papers have a large number of unusual phrases
      characteristic of LLMs. Luque was suspended for 13 years from the
      University of Cordoba, though not for the use of ChatGPT.[141] Many
      authors argue that the use of ChatGPT in academia for teaching and review
      is problematic precisely due to ChatGPT's tendency to
      "hallucinate."[142][143][144] Robin Bauwens, an assistant professor at
      Tilburg University, found this issue when he received a peer review report
      on his article generated by ChatGPT, as the report mentioned fake
      studies.[145] According to librarian Chris Granatino from Lemieux Library
      at Seattle University, although ChatGPT itself can generate content that
      seemingly includes legitimate citations, in practice, those citations are
      either not genuine or incorrect.[146]
