    <p id="paragraph">
      artificial intelligence (AI) By Ed BurnsNicole Laskowski, Senior News
      DirectorLinda Tucci, Industry Editor -- CIO/IT Strategy What is artificial
      intelligence (AI)? Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human
      intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. Specific
      applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing,
      speech recognition and machine vision. How does AI work? As the hype
      around AI has accelerated, vendors have been scrambling to promote how
      their products and services use it. Often, what they refer to as AI is
      simply a component of the technology, such as machine learning. AI
      requires a foundation of specialized hardware and software for writing and
      training machine learning algorithms. No single programming language is
      synonymous with AI, but Python, R, Java, C++ and Julia have features
      popular with AI developers. In general, AI systems work by ingesting large
      amounts of labeled training data, analyzing the data for correlations and
      patterns, and using these patterns to make predictions about future
      states. In this way, a chatbot that is fed examples of text can learn to
      generate lifelike exchanges with people, or an image recognition tool can
      learn to identify and describe objects in images by reviewing millions of
      examples. New, rapidly improving generative AI techniques can create
      realistic text, images, music and other media.

      Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by computers, as
      opposed to human or animal intelligence. "Intelligence" encompasses the
      ability to learn and to reason, to generalize, and to infer meaning.[1][2]
      AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search),
      recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix),
      understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars
      (e.g., Waymo), generative or creative tools (ChatGPT and AI art),
      automated decision-making, and competing at the highest level in strategic
      game systems (such as chess and Go).[3] Artificial intelligence was
      founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since it has
      experienced several waves of optimism,[4][5] followed by disappointment
      and the loss of funding (known as an "AI winter"),[6][7] followed by new
      approaches, success, and renewed funding.[5][8] AI research has tried and
      discarded many different approaches, including simulating the brain,
      modeling human problem solving, formal logic, large databases of
      knowledge, and imitating animal behavior. In the first decades of the 21st
      century, highly mathematical and statistical machine learning has
      dominated the field, and this technique has proved highly successful,
      helping to solve many challenging problems throughout industry and
      academia.[8][9] The various sub-fields of AI research are centered around
      particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of
      AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning,
      learning, natural language processing, perception, and the ability to move
      and manipulate objects.[a] General intelligence (the ability to solve an
      arbitrary problem) is among the field's long-term goals.[10][2] To solve
      these problems, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of
      problem-solving techniques, including search and mathematical
      optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based
      on statistics, probability, and economics. AI also draws upon computer
      science, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields. The
      field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence "can be so
      precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it".[b] This
      raised philosophical arguments about the mind and the ethical consequences
      of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence; these
      issues have previously been explored by myth, fiction (science fiction),
      and philosophy since antiquity.[12] Computer scientists and philosophers
      have since suggested that AI may become an existential risk to humanity if
      its rational capacities are not steered towards goals beneficial to
      humankind.[c] Economists have frequently highlighted the risks of
      redundancies from AI, and speculated about unemployment if there is no
      adequate social policy for full employment.[13] The term artificial
      intelligence has also been criticized for overhyping AI's true
      technological capabilities.[14][15][16] History Main articles: History of
      artificial intelligence and Timeline of artificial intelligence Silver
      didrachma from Crete depicting Talos, a mythical intelligent automaton (c.
      300 BC) Artificial beings with intelligence appeared as storytelling
      devices in antiquity,[17] and have been common in fiction, as in Mary
      Shelley's Frankenstein or Karel Čapek's R.U.R.[18] These characters and
      their fates raised many of the same issues now discussed in the ethics of
      artificial intelligence.[19] The study of mechanical or "formal" reasoning
      began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of
      mathematical logic led directly to Alan Turing's theory of computation,
      which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as "0" and
      "1", could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deduction. This
      insight that digital computers can simulate any process of formal
      reasoning is known as the Church–Turing thesis.[20] This, along with
      concurrent discoveries in neurobiology, information theory and
      cybernetics, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an
      electronic brain.[21] The first work that is now generally recognized as
      AI was McCullouch and Pitts' 1943 formal design for Turing-complete
      "artificial neurons".[22] The field of AI research was born at a workshop
      at Dartmouth College in 1956.[d][25] The attendees became the founders and
      leaders of AI research.[e] They and their students produced programs that
      the press described as "astonishing":[f] computers were learning checkers
      strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and
      speaking English.[g][27] By the middle of the 1960s, research in the U.S.
      was heavily funded by the Department of Defense[28] and laboratories had
      been established around the world.[29] Researchers in the 1960s and the
      1970s were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in
      creating a machine with artificial general intelligence and considered
      this the goal of their field.[30] Herbert Simon predicted, "machines will
      be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do".[31]
      Marvin Minsky agreed, writing, "within a generation ... the problem of
      creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved".[32] They
      had failed to recognize the difficulty of some of the remaining tasks.
      Progress slowed and in 1974, in response to the criticism of Sir James
      Lighthill[33] and ongoing pressure from the US Congress to fund more
      productive projects, both the U.S. and British governments cut off
      exploratory research in AI. The next few years would later be called an
      "AI winter", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was
      difficult.[6] In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the
      commercial success of expert systems,[34] a form of AI program that
      simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985,
      the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time,
      Japan's fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S. and British
      governments to restore funding for academic research.[5] However,
      beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once
      again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began.[7]
      Many researchers began to doubt that the current practices would be able
      to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception,
      robotics, learning and pattern recognition. A number of researchers began
      to look into "sub-symbolic" approaches to specific AI problems.[35]
      Robotics researchers, such as Rodney Brooks, rejected symbolic AI and
      focused on the basic engineering problems that would allow robots to move,
      survive, and learn their environment.[h] Interest in neural networks and
      "connectionism" was revived by Geoffrey Hinton, David Rumelhart and others
      in the middle of the 1980s.[40] Soft computing tools were developed in the
      1980s, such as neural networks, fuzzy systems, Grey system theory,
      evolutionary computation and many tools drawn from statistics or
      mathematical optimization. AI gradually restored its reputation in the
      late 1990s and early 21st century by exploiting formal mathematical
      methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems. This
      "narrow" and "formal" focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable
      results and collaborate with other fields (such as statistics, economics
      and mathematics).[41] By 2000, solutions developed by AI researchers were
      being widely used, although in the 1990s they were rarely described as
      "artificial intelligence".[9] Faster computers[42] and access to large
      amounts of data[43] enabled advances in machine learning and perception;
      data-hungry deep learning methods started to dominate accuracy benchmarks
      around 2012.[44] According to Bloomberg's Jack Clark, 2015 was a landmark
      year for artificial intelligence, with the number of software projects
      that use AI within Google increased from a "sporadic usage" in 2012 to
      more than 2,700 projects.[i] He attributed this to an increase in
      affordable neural networks, due to a rise in cloud computing
      infrastructure and to an increase in research tools and datasets.[8] In a
      2017 survey, one in five companies reported they had "incorporated AI in
      some offerings or processes".[45] The amount of research into AI (measured
      by total publications) increased by 50% in the years 2015–2019.[46]
      According to AI Impacts at Stanford, around 2022 about $50 billion
      annually is invested in artificial intelligence in the US, and about 20%
      of new US Computer Science PhD graduates have specialized in artificial
      intelligence;[47] about 800,000 AI-related US job openings existed in
      2022.[48] Numerous academic researchers became concerned that AI was no
      longer pursuing the original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent
      machines. Much of current research involves statistical AI, which is
      overwhelmingly used to solve specific problems, even highly successful
      techniques such as deep learning. This concern has led to the subfield of
      artificial general intelligence (or "AGI"),[2] which had several
      well-funded institutions by the 2010s.[10] Goals The general problem of
      simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken down into
      sub-problems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that
      researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described
      below have received the most attention.[a] Reasoning, problem-solving
      Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step
      reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical
      deductions.[49] By the late 1980s and 1990s, AI research had developed
      methods for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing
      concepts from probability and economics.[50] Many of these algorithms
      proved to be insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because
      they experienced a "combinatorial explosion": they became exponentially
      slower as the problems grew larger.[51] Even humans rarely use the
      step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most
      of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments.[52] Knowledge
      representation Main articles: Knowledge representation, Commonsense
      knowledge, Description logic, and Ontology (information science) An
      ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the
      relationships between those concepts. Knowledge representation and
      knowledge engineering[53] allow AI programs to answer questions
      intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. A representation
      of "what exists" is an ontology: the set of objects, relations, concepts,
      and properties formally described so that software agents can interpret
      them.[54] The most general ontologies are called upper ontologies, which
      attempt to provide a foundation for all other knowledge and act as
      mediators between domain ontologies that cover specific knowledge about a
      particular knowledge domain (field of interest or area of concern). A
      truly intelligent program would also need access to commonsense knowledge,
      the set of facts that an average person knows. The semantics of an
      ontology is typically represented in description logic, such as the Web
      Ontology Language.[55] AI research has developed tools to represent
      specific domains, such as objects, properties, categories and relations
      between objects;[55] situations, events, states and time;[56] causes and
      effects;[57] knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other
      people know); and [58] default reasoning (things that humans assume are
      true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other
      facts are changing);[59]. Among the most difficult problems in AI are: the
      breadth of commonsense knowledge (the number of atomic facts that the
      average person knows is enormous);[60] and the sub-symbolic form of most
      commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as
      "facts" or "statements" that they could express verbally).[52] Formal
      knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and
      retrieval,[61] scene interpretation,[62] clinical decision support,[63]
      knowledge discovery (mining "interesting" and actionable inferences from
      large databases),[64] and other areas.[65] Learning Main article: Machine
      learning Machine learning (ML), a fundamental concept of AI research since
      the field's inception,[j] is the study of computer algorithms that improve
      automatically through experience.[k] Unsupervised learning finds patterns
      in a stream of input. Supervised learning requires a human to label the
      input data first, and comes in two main varieties: classification and
      numerical regression. Classification is used to determine what category
      something belongs in – the program sees a number of examples of things
      from several categories and will learn to classify new inputs. Regression
      is the attempt to produce a function that describes the relationship
      between inputs and outputs and predicts how the outputs should change as
      the inputs change. Both classifiers and regression learners can be viewed
      as "function approximators" trying to learn an unknown (possibly implicit)
      function; for example, a spam classifier can be viewed as learning a
      function that maps from the text of an email to one of two categories,
      "spam" or "not spam".[69] In reinforcement learning the agent is rewarded
      for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent classifies its
      responses to form a strategy for operating in its problem space.[70]
      Transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied
      to a new problem.[71] Computational learning theory can assess learners by
      computational complexity, by sample complexity (how much data is
      required), or by other notions of optimization.[72] Natural language
      processing Main article: Natural language processing A parse tree
      represents the syntactic structure of a sentence according to some formal
      grammar. Natural language processing (NLP)[73] allows machines to read and
      understand human language. A sufficiently powerful natural language
      processing system would enable natural-language user interfaces and the
      acquisition of knowledge directly from human-written sources, such as
      newswire texts. Some straightforward applications of NLP include
      information retrieval, question answering and machine translation.[74]
      Symbolic AI used formal syntax to translate the deep structure of
      sentences into logic. This failed to produce useful applications, due to
      the intractability of logic[51] and the breadth of commonsense
      knowledge.[60] Modern statistical techniques include co-occurrence
      frequencies (how often one word appears near another), "Keyword spotting"
      (searching for a particular word to retrieve information),
      transformer-based deep learning (which finds patterns in text), and
      others.[75] They have achieved acceptable accuracy at the page or
      paragraph level, and, by 2019, could generate coherent text.[76]
      Perception Main articles: Machine perception, Computer vision, and Speech
      recognition Feature detection (pictured: edge detection) helps AI compose
      informative abstract structures out of raw data. Machine perception[77] is
      the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones,
      wireless signals, and active lidar, sonar, radar, and tactile sensors) to
      deduce aspects of the world. Applications include speech recognition,[78]
      facial recognition, and object recognition.[79] Computer vision is the
      ability to analyze visual input.[80] Social intelligence Main article:
      Affective computing Kismet, a robot with rudimentary social skills[81]
      Affective computing is an interdisciplinary umbrella that comprises
      systems that recognize, interpret, process or simulate human feeling,
      emotion and mood.[82] For example, some virtual assistants are programmed
      to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them
      appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or
      to otherwise facilitate human–computer interaction. However, this tends to
      give naïve users an unrealistic conception of how intelligent existing
      computer agents actually are.[83] Moderate successes related to affective
      computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently,
      multimodal sentiment analysis, wherein AI classifies the affects displayed
      by a videotaped subject.[84] General intelligence Main article: Artificial
      general intelligence A machine with general intelligence can solve a wide
      variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human
      intelligence. There are several competing ideas about how to develop
      artificial general intelligence. Hans Moravec and Marvin Minsky argue that
      work in different individual domains can be incorporated into an advanced
      multi-agent system or cognitive architecture with general
      intelligence.[85] Pedro Domingos hopes that there is a conceptually
      straightforward, but mathematically difficult, "master algorithm" that
      could lead to AGI.[86] Others believe that anthropomorphic features like
      an artificial brain[87] or simulated child development[l] will someday
      reach a critical point where general intelligence emerges. Tools Search
      and optimization Main articles: Search algorithm, Mathematical
      optimization, and Evolutionary computation AI can solve many problems by
      intelligently searching through many possible solutions.[88] Reasoning can
      be reduced to performing a search. For example, logical proof can be
      viewed as searching for a path that leads from premises to conclusions,
      where each step is the application of an inference rule.[89] Planning
      algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find
      a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis.[90]
      Robotics algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use local
      searches in configuration space.[91] Simple exhaustive searches[92] are
      rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space (the
      number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers. The
      result is a search that is too slow or never completes. The solution, for
      many problems, is to use "heuristics" or "rules of thumb" that prioritize
      choices in favor of those more likely to reach a goal and to do so in a
      shorter number of steps. In some search methodologies, heuristics can also
      serve to eliminate some choices unlikely to lead to a goal (called
      "pruning the search tree"). Heuristics supply the program with a "best
      guess" for the path on which the solution lies.[93] Heuristics limit the
      search for solutions into a smaller sample size.[94] A particle swarm
      seeking the global minimum A very different kind of search came to
      prominence in the 1990s, based on the mathematical theory of optimization.
      For many problems, it is possible to begin the search with some form of a
      guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements
      can be made. These algorithms can be visualized as blind hill climbing: we
      begin the search at a random point on the landscape, and then, by jumps or
      steps, we keep moving our guess uphill, until we reach the top. Other
      related optimization algorithms include random optimization, beam search
      and metaheuristics like simulated annealing.[95] Evolutionary computation
      uses a form of optimization search. For example, they may begin with a
      population of organisms (the guesses) and then allow them to mutate and
      recombine, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation (refining
      the guesses). Classic evolutionary algorithms include genetic algorithms,
      gene expression programming, and genetic programming.[96] Alternatively,
      distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence
      algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm
      optimization (inspired by bird flocking) and ant colony optimization
      (inspired by ant trails).[97] Logic Main articles: Logic programming and
      Automated reasoning Logic[98] is used for knowledge representation and
      problem-solving, but it can be applied to other problems as well. For
      example, the satplan algorithm uses logic for planning[99] and inductive
      logic programming is a method for learning.[100] Several different forms
      of logic are used in AI research. Propositional logic[101] involves truth
      functions such as "or" and "not". First-order logic[102] adds quantifiers
      and predicates and can express facts about objects, their properties, and
      their relations with each other. Fuzzy logic assigns a "degree of truth"
      (between 0 and 1) to vague statements such as "Alice is old" (or rich, or
      tall, or hungry), that are too linguistically imprecise to be completely
      true or false.[103] Default logics, non-monotonic logics and
      circumscription are forms of logic designed to help with default reasoning
      and the qualification problem.[59] Several extensions of logic have been
      designed to handle specific domains of knowledge, such as description
      logics;[55] situation calculus, event calculus and fluent calculus (for
      representing events and time);[56] causal calculus;[57] belief calculus
      (belief revision); and modal logics.[58] Logics to model contradictory or
      inconsistent statements arising in multi-agent systems have also been
      designed, such as paraconsistent logics.[104] Probabilistic methods for
      uncertain reasoning Main articles: Bayesian network, Hidden Markov model,
      Kalman filter, Particle filter, Decision theory, and Utility theory
      Expectation-maximization clustering of Old Faithful eruption data starts
      from a random guess but then successfully converges on an accurate
      clustering of the two physically distinct modes of eruption. Many problems
      in AI (including in reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and
      robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain
      information. AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these
      problems using methods from probability theory and economics.[105]
      Bayesian networks[106] are a very general tool that can be used for
      various problems, including reasoning (using the Bayesian inference
      algorithm),[m][108] learning (using the expectation-maximization
      algorithm),[n][110] planning (using decision networks)[111] and perception
      (using dynamic Bayesian networks).[112] Probabilistic algorithms can also
      be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing and finding explanations for
      streams of data, helping perception systems to analyze processes that
      occur over time (e.g., hidden Markov models or Kalman filters).[112] A key
      concept from the science of economics is "utility", a measure of how
      valuable something is to an intelligent agent. Precise mathematical tools
      have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan,
      using decision theory, decision analysis,[113] and information value
      theory.[114] These tools include models such as Markov decision
      processes,[115] dynamic decision networks,[112] game theory and mechanism
      design.[116] Classifiers and statistical learning methods Main articles:
      Statistical classification and Machine learning The simplest AI
      applications can be divided into two types: classifiers ("if shiny then
      diamond") and controllers ("if diamond then pick up"). Controllers do,
      however, also classify conditions before inferring actions, and therefore
      classification forms a central part of many AI systems. Classifiers are
      functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match. They
      can be tuned according to examples, making them very attractive for use in
      AI. These examples are known as observations or patterns. In supervised
      learning, each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class. A class is a
      decision that has to be made. All the observations combined with their
      class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received,
      that observation is classified based on previous experience.[117] A
      classifier can be trained in various ways; there are many statistical and
      machine learning approaches. The decision tree is the simplest and most
      widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm.[118] K-nearest neighbor
      algorithm was the most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s.[119]
      Kernel methods such as the support vector machine (SVM) displaced
      k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s.[120] The naive Bayes classifier is
      reportedly the "most widely used learner"[121] at Google, due in part to
      its scalability.[122] Neural networks are also used for
      classification.[123] Classifier performance depends greatly on the
      characteristics of the data to be classified, such as the dataset size,
      distribution of samples across classes, dimensionality, and the level of
      noise. Model-based classifiers perform well if the assumed model is an
      extremely good fit for the actual data. Otherwise, if no matching model is
      available, and if accuracy (rather than speed or scalability) is the sole
      concern, conventional wisdom is that discriminative classifiers
      (especially SVM) tend to be more accurate than model-based classifiers
      such as "naive Bayes" on most practical data sets.[124] Artificial neural
      networks Main articles: Artificial neural network and Connectionism A
      neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast
      network of neurons in the human brain. Neural networks[123] were inspired
      by the architecture of neurons in the human brain. A simple "neuron" N
      accepts input from other neurons, each of which, when activated (or
      "fired"), casts a weighted "vote" for or against whether neuron N should
      itself activate. Learning requires an algorithm to adjust these weights
      based on the training data; one simple algorithm (dubbed "fire together,
      wire together") is to increase the weight between two connected neurons
      when the activation of one triggers the successful activation of another.
      Neurons have a continuous spectrum of activation; in addition, neurons can
      process inputs in a nonlinear way rather than weighing straightforward
      votes. Modern neural networks model complex relationships between inputs
      and outputs and find patterns in data. They can learn continuous functions
      and even digital logical operations. Neural networks can be viewed as a
      type of mathematical optimization – they perform gradient descent on a
      multi-dimensional topology that was created by training the network. The
      most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm.[125]
      Other learning techniques for neural networks are Hebbian learning ("fire
      together, wire together"), GMDH or competitive learning.[126] The main
      categories of networks are acyclic or feedforward neural networks (where
      the signal passes in only one direction) and recurrent neural networks
      (which allow feedback and short-term memories of previous input events).
      Among the most popular feedforward networks are perceptrons, multi-layer
      perceptrons and radial basis networks.[127] Deep learning Representing
      Images on Multiple Layers of Abstraction in Deep Learning Representing
      images on multiple layers of abstraction in deep learning[128] Deep
      learning[129] uses several layers of neurons between the network's inputs
      and outputs. The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level
      features from the raw input. For example, in image processing, lower
      layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts
      relevant to a human such as digits or letters or faces.[130] Deep learning
      has drastically improved the performance of programs in many important
      subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision, speech
      recognition, image classification[131] and others. Deep learning often
      uses convolutional neural networks for many or all of its layers. In a
      convolutional layer, each neuron receives input from only a restricted
      area of the previous layer called the neuron's receptive field. This can
      substantially reduce the number of weighted connections between
      neurons,[132] and creates a hierarchy similar to the organization of the
      animal visual cortex.[133] In a recurrent neural network (RNN) the signal
      will propagate through a layer more than once;[134] thus, an RNN is an
      example of deep learning.[135] RNNs can be trained by gradient
      descent,[136] however long-term gradients which are back-propagated can
      "vanish" (that is, they can tend to zero) or "explode" (that is, they can
      tend to infinity), known as the vanishing gradient problem.[137] The long
      short term memory (LSTM) technique can prevent this in most cases.[138]
      Specialized languages and hardware Main articles: Programming languages
      for artificial intelligence and Hardware for artificial intelligence
      Specialized languages for artificial intelligence have been developed,
      such as Lisp, Prolog, TensorFlow and many others. Hardware developed for
      AI includes AI accelerators and neuromorphic computing. By 2019, graphics
      processing units (GPUs), often with AI-specific enhancements, had
      displaced central processing unit (CPUs) as the dominant means to train
      large-scale commercial cloud AI.[139] Applications Main article:
      Applications of artificial intelligence See also: Embodied cognition and
      Legal informatics For this 2018 project of the artist Joseph Ayerle the AI
      had to learn the typical patterns in the colors and brushstrokes of
      Renaissance painter Raphael. The portrait shows the face of the actress
      Ornella Muti, "painted" by AI in the style of Raphael. AI is relevant to
      any intellectual task.[140] Modern artificial intelligence techniques are
      pervasive and are too numerous to list here.[141] Frequently, when a
      technique reaches mainstream use, it is no longer considered artificial
      intelligence; this phenomenon is described as the AI effect.[142] In the
      2010s, AI applications were at the heart of the most commercially
      successful areas of computing, and have become a ubiquitous feature of
      daily life. AI is used in search engines (such as Google Search),
      targeting online advertisements,[143] recommendation systems (offered by
      Netflix, YouTube or Amazon), driving internet traffic,[144][145] targeted
      advertising (AdSense, Facebook), virtual assistants (such as Siri or
      Alexa),[146] autonomous vehicles (including drones, ADAS and self-driving
      cars), automatic language translation (Microsoft Translator, Google
      Translate), facial recognition (Apple's Face ID or Microsoft's DeepFace),
      image labeling (used by Facebook, Apple's iPhoto and TikTok), spam
      filtering and chatbots (such as ChatGPT). There are also thousands of
      successful AI applications used to solve problems for specific industries
      or institutions. A few examples are energy storage,[147] deepfakes,[148]
      medical diagnosis, military logistics, foreign policy,[149] or supply
      chain management. Game playing has been a test of AI's strength since the
      1950s. Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a
      reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, on 11 May 1997.[150] In
      2011, in a Jeopardy! quiz show exhibition match, IBM's question answering
      system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter
      and Ken Jennings, by a significant margin.[151] In March 2016, AlphaGo won
      4 out of 5 games of Go in a match with Go champion Lee Sedol, becoming the
      first computer Go-playing system to beat a professional Go player without
      handicaps.[152] Other programs handle imperfect-information games; such as
      for poker at a superhuman level, Pluribus[o] and Cepheus.[154] DeepMind in
      the 2010s developed a "generalized artificial intelligence" that could
      learn many diverse Atari games on its own.[155] DeepMind's AlphaFold 2
      (2020) demonstrated the ability to approximate, in hours rather than
      months, the 3D structure of a protein.[156] Other applications predict the
      result of judicial decisions,[157] create art (such as poetry or painting)
      and prove mathematical theorems. Generative AI gained widespread
      prominence in the 2020s. "Large language model" systems such as GPT-3
      (2020), with 175 billion parameters, matched human performance on
      pre-existing benchmarks, albeit without the system attaining a commonsense
      understanding of the contents of the benchmarks.[158] A Pew Research poll
      conducted in March 2023 found that 14% of Americans adults had tried
      ChatGPT, a large language model fine-tuned using reinforcement learning
      from human feedback.[159] While estimates varied wildly, Goldman Sachs
      suggested in 2023 that generative language AI could increase global GDP by
      7% in the next ten years.[160][161] In 2023, the increasing realism and
      ease-of-use of AI-based text-to-image generators such as Midjourney,
      DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion[162][163] sparked a trend of viral
      AI-generated photos. Widespread attention was gained by a fake photo of
      Pope Francis wearing a white puffer coat,[164] the fictional arrest of
      Donald Trump,[165] and a hoax of an attack on the Pentagon,[166] as well
      as the usage in professional creative arts.[167][168]
