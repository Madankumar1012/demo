    <p id="story">
      The Eternals are a fictional race of humanoids appearing in American comic
      books published by Marvel Comics. They were created by Jack Kirby, making
      their first appearance in The Eternals #1 (July 1976).[1] In the Marvel
      Universe, the Eternals are an offshoot of humanity known as Homo
      immortalis which were created one million years ago by the enigmatic alien
      Celestials to defend Earth with their superhuman powers and abilities.
      Their primary adversaries are the Deviants, who share a similar origin and
      pose a regular threat to humanity. Due to their virtual immortality,
      Eternals have largely secluded themselves from humans, with their god-like
      status forming the basis of various mythological figures around the world.
      Since their appearance, the Eternals have had several of their own series,
      in addition to crossing into other titles, such as Thor and X-Men.[2][3]
      They made their debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with their own
      feature film Eternals, directed by Chloé Zhao, which was released November
      5, 2021.[4] Publication history In 1970, Jack Kirby left Marvel Comics to
      work at DC Comics, where he began the saga of the New Gods, an epic story
      involving mythological and science fiction concepts. Though he had planned
      for a definitive ending, the series was abruptly cancelled. Upon his
      return to Marvel, Kirby continued exploring his interest in high-concept
      science fiction through The Eternals.[5] Originally titled "The
      Celestials", Marvel changed the title to "Return of the Gods", whose comic
      book cover bore stylistics similarities to Erich von Daniken's book
      Chariots of the Gods?. To avoid potential legal issues, the name was again
      changed to “Eternals".[6] The Eternals' saga was thematically similar to
      the New Gods', and the series was also eventually canceled without
      resolving many of its plots.[7][8][9] Writers Roy Thomas and Mark
      Gruenwald used the Eternals in a Thor storyline that concluded in Thor
      #301,[10] resolving those lingering plotlines. Subsequent to the Thor
      storyline, the Eternals (and the mythology connected to them) have
      appeared or been mentioned in numerous Marvel comics.[9][7] In particular,
      the Celestials' experiment on humanity has been used to explain how
      certain humans can develop super-powers. The Titanians (created by Jim
      Starlin) and Uranians (created by Stan Lee)[11] were later retconned as
      being Eternals as well.[12][9] The Eternals returned for a 12-issue
      miniseries in 1985 under writer Peter B. Gillis and penciler Sal
      Buscema.[7][13][14] According to comic-book historian Peter Sanderson,
      "editor in chief Jim Shooter disliked Gillis’s scripts, so Walter Simonson
      wrote the final four issues."[15] In 2000, a one-shot comic called New
      Eternals: Apocalypse Now #1 featured an older conflict between the
      Eternals and X-Men villain Apocalypse. In 2003, writer Chuck Austen and
      artist Kev Walker rebooted the franchise for Marvel's mature
      readers-focused MAX imprint, resulting in The Eternal.[7][16] The Eternal
      series from Marvel's MAX imprint written by Chuck Austen was based on an
      idea he had been working on for a while: "I pitched this back when I first
      started working at Marvel, but Joe Quesada was against doing it. He saw no
      future in this particular old Kirby concept." Austen described the plot as
      involving "Ikaeden, the leader of the Eternals, who arrives on Earth at
      the dawn of man, and evolves humankind from homo-erectus so he can use
      them as slaves to mine raw materials for the Celestials, his bosses,
      basically," as well as "Kurassus, who is the second-in-command of the
      mining mission, and who is determined to undermine Ikaeden and kill
      Ikaeden's precious slave-girl and son."[17] In an interview with Newsarama
      he gave an outline of his planned plot: In this version, we take some of
      the concepts from [the original series] and build around them, throwing
      away some stuff and keeping others. We're actually going back in time to
      see Ikaris birth and development on Earth, meet his parents, and then move
      forward into contemporary time. When we get to contemporary time, the
      Celestials return to judge Earth, but there's no fifty-year 'study and
      evaluation period.' We've already been judged and found wanting, too
      violent to be allowed to flourish and spread, and Ikaris and the others
      have to stop the Celestials, who consider us their property, from
      destroying the entire planet as they have done to many others, including
      another in the Solar System.[18] Originally planned as an ongoing
      series,[17] it was cancelled after six issues.[19] Neil Gaiman,[20][21]
      with artist John Romita, Jr.,[22] created a 2006 miniseries, which helped
      bring the Eternals' role in the modern Marvel Universe up-to-date.[23]
      Originally solicited as a six-issue series, an extra issue was added to
      the run, because, according to editor Nick Lowe, "There was too much story
      to fit into the structure we set for ourselves. Neil was starting issue
      five and told me that he might need a seventh issue. He just had too much
      story to fit in six issues (even with the first and sixth
      double-sized)."[24] A fourth Eternals series ran as an ongoing series for
      nine issues and one annual from August 2008 – March 2009. The Eternals
      returned in Jason Aaron's Avengers, a story arc involving the Dark
      Celestials, which saw the Eternals all killed in the fourth issue.
      However, the characters were resurrected in their new ongoing series
      launched in January 2021 by writer Kieron Gillen and artist Esad Ribić.
      [9][25] Fictional history When the Celestials visited Earth one million
      years ago and performed genetic experiments on early proto-humans, they
      created two divergent races: the long-lived Eternals, and the genetically
      unstable and monstrously grotesque Deviants. These experiments also led to
      the capacity for super-powered mutations in humans. They also performed
      this experiment on other planets (such as the Kree and Skrull homeworlds)
      with similar results. Despite looking human, Eternals are much
      longer-lived (but were not originally fully immortal) and that kept them
      from having much contact with their human cousins. Eternals have a low
      birth rate; they can interbreed with humans but the result is always a
      normal human (although Joey Athena, son of Thena and a normal human seems
      to have become an Eternal with long lived properties and powers).[26]
      Despite this, the Eternals have in general protected the human race,
      especially from the Deviants, with whom they have always had an enmity.
      The Eternals also developed advanced technology.[citation needed] Long
      ago, a civil war broke out amongst the Eternals over whether to conquer
      the other races, with one faction led by Kronos and the other by his
      warlike brother, Uranos. Kronos's side prevailed, and Uranos and his
      defeated faction left Earth and journeyed to Uranus where they built a
      colony. Some of Uranos's group soon tried to return to Earth to re
