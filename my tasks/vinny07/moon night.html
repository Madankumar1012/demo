      Moon Knight is a character appearing in American comic books published by
      Marvel Comics. Created by writer Doug Moench and artist Don Perlin, the
      character first appeared in Werewolf by Night #32 (August 1975).[1] The
      son of a rabbi, Marc Spector served as a Force Recon Marine and briefly as
      a CIA operative before becoming a mercenary alongside his friend Jean-Paul
      "Frenchie" DuChamp. During a job in Sudan, Spector is appalled when
      ruthless fellow mercenary Raoul Bushman attacks and kills archeologist Dr.
      Alraune in front of the man's daughter and colleague, Marlene Alraune.
      After fighting Bushman and being left for dead, a mortally wounded Spector
      reaches Alraune's recently unearthed tomb and is placed before a statue of
      the Egyptian moon god Khonshu. Spector dies, then suddenly revives, fully
      healed. He claims Khonshu wants him to be the "moon's knight", the left
      "Fist of Khonshu", redeeming his life of violence by now protecting and
      avenging the innocent. While early stories imply Spector is merely insane,
      it is later revealed Khonshu is real, one of several entities from the
      Othervoid (a dimension outside normal time and space) once worshipped by
      ancient Earth people. On his return to the United States, Spector invests
      his mercenary profits into becoming the crimefighter "Moon Knight", aided
      by Frenchie and Marlene Alraune, who becomes his lover and eventually the
      mother of his daughter. Along with his costumed alter ego, he primarily
      uses three other identities to gain information from different social
      circles: billionaire businessman Steven Grant, taxicab driver Jake
      Lockley, and suited detective and police consultant Mr. Knight. It is
      later revealed Moon Knight has dissociative identity disorder (DID)
      (incorrectly referred to as schizophrenia in some stories) and that the
      alters known as Grant and Lockley originally manifested during his
      childhood. Other subsequent alter egos who do not assume the Moon Knight
      identity have emerged at other points during his adulthood, including a
      werewolf-fighting astronaut; impersonators of Khonshu, Spider-Man,
      Wolverine, Captain America, Iron Man, and Echo; and a red-haired little
      girl known as the Inner Child (who first appeared in the Ultimate Marvel
      continuity). It is debated in different stories whether Spector has
      genuine DID due to childhood trauma or if his similar symptoms are the
      result of "brain damage" caused by his psychic connection to Khonshu, a
      connection compelling his personality to shift between the four major
      aspects of the moon god's multi-faceted nature ("the traveler", "the
      pathfinder", "the embracer", and "the defender of those who travel at
      night"). Khonshu claims he created a psychic connection with Spector,
      Grant, and Lockley when the latter were young, decades before they became
      Moon Knight.[2] In most of his stories, Moon Knight has no supernatural
      abilities beyond occasional visions of mystic insight. He relies on
      athletic ability, advanced technology, expert combat and detective skills,
      and a high tolerance for pain based on willpower, training, and
      experience. Since becoming Moon Knight, there have been multiple occasions
      when the character has died only to then be resurrected by Khonshu,
      implying he may now be effectively immortal until the moon god's
      protection is revoked (whether Khonshu has limitations on how often he can
      resurrect Spector is unknown). For a time, Moon Knight's strength and
      resistance to injury could reach superhuman levels depending on the phases
      of the moon, but this ability later vanished, while the Moon Knight
      identity is occasionally depicted as an independent alter ego of the
      others.[3] The character has made appearances in various media outside of
      comics, including animated series and video games. Oscar Isaac portrays
      Marc Spector / Moon Knight, Steven Grant / Mr. Knight, and Jake Lockley in
      the Marvel Cinematic Universe live-action television series Moon Knight
      (2022). Development In an interview, Doug Moench recalled the character's
      genesis: "Somebody mentioned in the office and suggested using the
      committee, and that I should bring The Committee back, and then I found
      out who The Committee were and thought, well they're really boring, I
      don't wanna use them. And then I thought, well wait a minute, how about,
      if The Committee hires a mercenary, to kill the werewolf. And I thought
      yeah that's a good idea then I create this new character and it won't be
      these boring guys in business suits, it would be a flashy character. So I
      said who is best to kill the werewolf ? Well someone who uses Silver
      weapons because Silver hurts the werewolf. And tied to the night because
      the werewolf only comes out at night, and I'll base this character on the
      Moon, because the Moon makes the werewolf change, and this is going to be
      the opposite of the werewolf, and as soon as I said the Moon I said, ooh
      I'll have a costume that's just like the Moon, just black and white, jet
      and silver, no color on the costume."[4] Don Perlin also commented on the
      creation of the character, "We were told we needed a costumed character in
      the book. So Doug and I created Moon Knight. I wanted the costume to be
      just black and white. Since he'd be on a color page, that would make him a
      little bit different. He had a silver baton he could use when he battled
      werewolves. See, he was hired to track down to kill the werewolf."[5]
