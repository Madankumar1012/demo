        Fine-art photography
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Fine-art photography is photography created in line with the vision of
        the photographer as artist, using photography as a medium for creative
        expression. The goal of fine-art photography is to express an idea, a
        message, or an emotion.

        Fashion photography

        <br />
        <br />
        Fashion photography is a genre of photography that portrays clothing and
        other fashion items. This sometimes includes haute couture garments. It
        typically consists of a fashion photographer taking pictures of a
        dressed model in a photographic studio or an outside setting.

        Digital photography
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Digital photography uses cameras containing arrays of electronic
        photodetectors interfaced to an analog-to-digital converter to produce
        images focused by a lens, as opposed to an exposure on photographic
        film.

        Landscape photography
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Landscape photography shows the spaces within the world, sometimes vast
        and unending, but other times microscopic. Landscape photographs
        typically capture the presence of nature but can also focus on
        human-made features or disturbances of landscapes. Landscape photography
        is done for a variety of reasons.

      <dd id="story">Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating images by
      recording light, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or
      chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic
      film. It is employed in many fields of science, manufacturing (e.g.,
      photolithography), and business, as well as its more direct uses for art,
      film and video production, recreational purposes, hobby, and mass
      communication.[1] Typically, a lens is used to focus the light reflected
      or emitted from objects into a real image on the light-sensitive surface
      inside a camera during a timed exposure. With an electronic image sensor,
      this produces an electrical charge at each pixel, which is electronically
      processed and stored in a digital image file for subsequent display or
      processing. The result with photographic emulsion is an invisible latent
      image, which is later chemically "developed" into a visible image, either
      negative or positive, depending on the purpose of the photographic
      material and the method of processing. A negative image on film is
      traditionally used to photographically create a positive image on a paper
      base, known as a print, either by using an enlarger or by contact
      printing. Etymology The word "photography" was created from the Greek
      roots φωτός (phōtós), genitive of φῶς (phōs), "light"[2] and γραφή
      (graphé) "representation by means of lines" or "drawing",[3] together
      meaning "drawing with light".[4] Several people may have coined the same
      new term from these roots independently. Hércules Florence, a French
      painter and inventor living in Campinas, Brazil, used the French form of
      the word, photographie, in private notes which a Brazilian historian
      believes were written in 1834.[5] This claim is widely reported but is not
      yet largely recognized internationally. The first use of the word by
      Florence became widely known after the research of Boris Kossoy in
      1980.[6] The German newspaper Vossische Zeitung of 25 February 1839
      contained an article entitled Photographie, discussing several priority
      claims – especially Henry Fox Talbot's – regarding Daguerre's claim of
      invention.[7] The article is the earliest known occurrence of the word in
      public print.[8] It was signed "J.M.", believed to have been Berlin
      astronomer Johann von Maedler.[9] The astronomer John Herschel is also
      credited with coining the word, independent of Talbot, in 1839.[10] The
      inventors Nicéphore Niépce, Talbot, and Louis Daguerre seem not to have
      known or used the word "photography", but referred to their processes as
      "Heliography" (Niépce), "Photogenic Drawing"/"Talbotype"/"Calotype"
      (Talbot), and "Daguerreotype" (Daguerre).[9]</dd>
