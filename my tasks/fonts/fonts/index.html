      Languages spoken by the remaining 2.31% of the population belong to the
      Austroasiatic, Sino–Tibetan, Tai–Kadai, and a few other minor language
      families and isolates.[10]: 283  As per the People's Linguistic Survey of
      India, India has the second highest number of languages (780), after Papua
      New Guinea (840).[11] Ethnologue lists a lower number of 456.[12] Article
      343 of the Constitution of India stated that the official language of the
      Union is Hindi in Devanagari script, with official use of English to
      continue for 15 years from 1947. Later, a constitutional amendment, The
      Official Languages Act, 1963, allowed for the continuation of English
      alongside Hindi in the Indian government indefinitely until legislation
      decides to change it.[2] The form of numerals to be used for the official
      purposes of the Union are "the international form of Indian
      numerals",[13][14] which are referred to as Arabic numerals in most
      English-speaking countries.[1] Despite the misconceptions, Hindi is not
      the national language of India; the Constitution of India does not give
      any language the status of national language.[15][16] The Eighth Schedule
      of the Indian Constitution lists 22 languages,[17] which have been
      referred to as scheduled languages and given recognition, status and
      official encouragement. In addition, the Government of India has awarded
      the distinction of classical language to Kannada, Malayalam, Odia,
      Sanskrit, Tamil and Telugu. Classical language status is given to
      languages which have a rich heritage and independent nature. According to
      the Census of India of 2001, India has 122 major languages and 1599 other
      languages. However, figures from other sources vary, primarily due to
      differences in definition of the terms "language" and "dialect". The 2001
      Census recorded 30 languages which were spoken by more than a million
      native speakers and 122 which were spoken by more than 10,000 people.[18]
      Two contact languages have played an important role in the history of
      India: Persian[19] and English.[20] Persian was the court language during
      the Mughal period in India. It reigned as an administrative language for
      several centuries until the era of British colonisation.[21] English
      continues to be an important language in India. It is used in higher
      education and in some areas of the Indian government. Hindi, which has the
      largest number of first-language speakers in India today,[22] serves as
      the lingua franca across much of northern and central India. However,
      there have been concerns raised with Hindi being imposed in South India,
      most notably in the states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka,[23][24] as well as
      in Maharashtra, West Bengal, Assam, Punjab and other non-Hindi regions
      have also started to voice concerns about Hindi.[25] Bengali is the second
      most spoken and understood language in the country with a significant
      amount of speakers in eastern and northeastern regions. Marathi is the
      third most spoken and understood language in the country with a
      significant amount of speakers in South-Western regions.[26] History Main

      in the Indian subcontinent The Southern Indian languages are from the
      Dravidian family. The Dravidian languages are indigenous to the Indian
      subcontinent.[27] Proto-Dravidian languages were spoken in India in the
      4th millennium BCE and started disintegrating into various branches around
      3rd millennium BCE.[28] The Dravidian languages are classified in four
      groups: North, Central (Kolami–Parji), South-Central (Telugu–Kui), and
      South Dravidian (Tamil-Kannada).[29] The Northern Indian languages from
      the Indo-Aryan branch of the Indo-European family evolved from Old
      Indo-Aryan by way of the Middle Indo-Aryan Prakrit languages and
      Apabhraṃśa of the Middle Ages. The Indo-Aryan languages developed and
      emerged in three stages — Old Indo-Aryan (1500 BCE to 600 BCE), Middle
      Indo-Aryan stage (600 BCE and 1000 CE), and New Indo-Aryan (between 1000
      CE and 1300 CE). The modern north Indian Indo-Aryan languages all evolved
      into distinct, recognisable languages in the New Indo-Aryan Age.[30] In
      the Northeast India, among the Sino-Tibetan languages, Meitei language
      (officially known as Manipuri language) was the court language of the
      Manipur Kingdom (Meitei: Meeteileipak). It was honoured before and during
      the darbar sessions before Manipur was merged into the Dominion of the
      Indian Republic. Its history of existence spans from 1500 to 2000 years
      according to most eminent scholars including Padma Vibhushan awardee
      Suniti Kumar Chatterji.[31][32] Even according to the "Manipur State
      Constitution Act, 1947" of the once independent Manipur, Manipuri and
      English were made the court languages of the kingdom (before merging into
      Indian Republic).[33][34] Persian, or Farsi, was brought into India by the
      Ghaznavids and other Turko-Afghan dynasties as the court language.
      Culturally Persianized, they, in combination with the later Mughal dynasty
      (of Turco-Mongol origin), influenced the art, history, and literature of
      the region for more than 500 years, resulting in the Persianisation of
      many Indian tongues, mainly lexically. In 1837, the British replaced
      Persian with English and Hindustani in Perso-Arabic script for
      administrative purposes and the Hindi movement of the 19th Century
      replaced Persianised vocabulary with Sanskrit derivations and replaced or
      supplemented the use of Perso-Arabic script for administrative purposes
      with Devanagari.[19][35] Each of the northern Indian languages had
      different influences. For example, Hindustani was strongly influenced by
      Sanskrit, Arabic and Persian, leading to the emergence of Modern Standard
      Hindi and Modern Standard Urdu as registers of the Hindustani language.
      Bangla on the other hand has retained its Sanskritic roots while heavily
      expanding its vocabulary with words from Persian, English, French and
      other foreign language
